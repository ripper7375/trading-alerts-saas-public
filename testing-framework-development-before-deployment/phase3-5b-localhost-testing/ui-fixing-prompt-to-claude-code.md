Claude Code's task was: "Build dashboard and layout components" from files in docs/build-orders/ folder

I have tested by made local deployment (localhost : 3000) to explore frontend UI built from files in docs/build-orders/ folder by Claude Code,

Here are Current Status Summary to what Claude Code had completed

Phase 3: Dashboard & Layout Components
├─ ✅ Dashboard components (building blocks)
├─ ✅ Main Dashboard Page (landing)
├─ ✅ Layout Components (header, sidebar, cards, naviation)
├─ ❌ Styling System (missing Tailwind/shadcn config)
├─ ❌ Sub-pages (charts, alerts, watchlist, etc.)
└─ ❌ Button/Interactive functionality (need routing/handlers)

What Claude Code delivered:

✅ Dashboard components (building blocks)
✅ Main dashboard page
✅ Layout structure (header, sidebar, navigation)

What Claude Code didn't deliver (likely needs separate tasks):

❌ Feature pages (charts, alerts, etc.)
❌ Full styling configuration
❌ Interactive functionality

As Claude Code had finished Dashboard components (building blocks), Main dashboard page, and Layout structure (header, sidebar, navigation) but still not finish Feature pages (charts, alerts, etc.), Full styling configuration (missing Tailwind/shadcn config)), and Interactive / Button functionality (need routing/handlers)

I think I will delegate Feature pages (charts, alerts, etc.), Full styling configuration (missing Tailwind/shadcn config)), and Interactive / Button functionality (need routing/handlers) to Antigravity (Google AI IDE)

That means Claude Code continue build Dashboard components (building blocks), Main dashboard page, and Layout structure (header, sidebar, navigation) then Antigravity follow up building of Feature pages (charts, alerts, etc.), Full styling configuration (missing Tailwind/shadcn config)), and Interactive / Button functionality (need routing/handlers) ---> Working in parallel with each other

Do you think my idea is good ?
