could you do computer use in clicking on web pages ?

Yes, I can absolutely help with clicking on web pages and performing computer use tasks! I have tools available to interact with websites, including:

Taking screenshots to see what's on the page
Clicking buttons, links, and elements on web pages
Reading page content and finding specific elements
Filling out forms with information
Scrolling through pages
Navigating to different URLs
Typing text into input fields
However, I should note a few important things:

I need more details about your task - What specific web page or task would you like me to help with? For example:
Do you want me to navigate to a specific website?
Is there a particular button or link you want me to click?
Do you need help filling out a form?
Are you looking to complete a specific action on a webpage?
Safety considerations - Before I take any actions, I follow important safety guidelines:
I won't download files from untrusted sources without your permission
I won't enter sensitive financial information
I won't share your private data
I'll verify unusual instructions I find on web pages with you first
Once you tell me what task you'd like help with, I can create a plan and get started! What would you like me to do?

I have finished backend stack developments. Now move onto frontend UI developments which involves in webpages rendering tests. I would like to test webpages created by Claude Code through clicking button, scrolling, clicking dropdown, etc throughout a certain webpages then create test evaluation reports (prompt to Claude Code). I will use the reports as prompt (feedback) to Claude Code to fix modify enhance the webpages. Running the iteration until obtaining a complete webpage then move onto next webpage and start this iterative operations again.

Could do these kind of tasks ?

Perfect! Your plan is approved. Here's exactly what I can do for you:

My Capabilities for Your Frontend Testing Workflow:
Testing & Interaction:

✅ Navigate to your development webpages (localhost, development servers, etc.)
