Based on the documents and screenshots you provided, you have successfully completed 100% of the "Automated" Deployment Preparation (Phase 3.5). Your CI/CD pipeline is perfect.

However, according to your own roadmap (v7_phase_4_deployment.md), you are NOT yet ready for the "Physical" Deployment (Phase 4).

Here is the breakdown of what is done vs. what is missing:

✅ Completed (The "Cloud" Part)
[x] Vercel Project: Created and linked.

[x] Railway Database: PostgreSQL deployed and migrating correctly.

[x] CI/CD Pipeline: GitHub Actions automatically tests and deploys to Vercel/Railway.

[x] Environment Variables: Configured for Vercel & Railway.

[x] Health Checks: The "patient mode" verification script is working perfectly.

❌ Missing (The "Windows" Part)
Your document v7_phase_4_deployment.md lists these critical steps that GitHub Actions cannot do for you:

Provision Contabo Windows VPS:

Why: Railway runs Linux. MetaTrader 5 (MT5) requires Windows. Your Flask backend logic currently deployed to Railway is likely just a placeholder or will fail when it tries to open MT5.

Status: Not started.

Install 15 MT5 Terminals:

Why: You need 15 separate instances of MT5 running on that VPS to track different symbols/timeframes.

Status: Not started.

Manual Flask Deployment on VPS:

Why: The Flask code that controls MT5 must run on the same Windows machine as the terminals. You cannot deploy this via the current GitHub Action (which targets Railway).

Status: Not started.

Stripe Webhook Configuration:

Why: You need to tell Stripe where to send payment alerts (the URL .../api/webhooks/stripe).

Status: Likely pending (needs to be done in Stripe Dashboard).

My Recommendation: "Ignore the Missing Parts for Now"
You are "Complete Enough" to start coding.

You do not need the expensive Windows VPS right now to build the Login Page, Dashboard UI, or User Settings. You can mock the trading data for now.

Next Logical Step: Leave the Windows VPS tasks for Phase 4 (as your roadmap suggests). Right now, you should focus on Phase 3: Building the App.
