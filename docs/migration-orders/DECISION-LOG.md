# Decision Log — Flag Resolutions & Material Decisions

**What this is:** the append-only record of every flag resolution (F1–F19) and every
material decision made during the migration. The flag _register_ (what each flag asks) lives
in the plan §11; this file records _how each was resolved, by whom, with what evidence_.
The Executor writes entries at session close; Davin's sign-off is quoted where required.

**Entry format:**

```
## <ID> — <short title>
- Status: OPEN | RESOLVED | SUPERSEDED
- Session: <P-N where resolved>  ·  Date: <yyyy-mm-dd>
- Decision: <what was decided>
- Evidence: <commands run, docs read, URLs fetched, test results>
- Approved by: <Davin | n/a (technical, within bounds)>

_(Resolution entries append below this line — newest last)_

## F2 — Version pins: next@16.2.10 / @nestjs/core@11.1.28

- Status: RESOLVED
- Session: 0-1 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: Both exact target versions exist on the npm registry — pin as specified, no
  nearest-stable substitution needed. Current installed baselines: `next@^15.5.11` (root
  `package.json`), `@nestjs/core@^10.4.15` (`railway-gateway/package.json`) — the actual
  version bump happens in Phase 5 (Next.js) and Phase 4 (NestJS services), not this session.
- Evidence:
  - `npm view next@16.2.10 version` → `16.2.10`
  - `npm view @nestjs/core@11.1.28 version` → `11.1.28`
  - `npm view @nestjs/core versions --json` → confirms `"11.1.28"` present in the full
    published version list
- Approved by: n/a (technical, within bounds — verification only, no deviation from the
  plan's stated target)

## F19 (npm-check portion) — Prisma 7.8.0 exists on npm; major-version-count correction

- Status: RESOLVED (npm-check only — full 6→7 breaking-change audit remains OPEN, due
  Session 2-1)
- Session: 0-1 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: `prisma@7.8.0` exists on the npm registry — pin as specified. **Finding:** plan
  §2 step 0.6 frames this as a "5→6→7" jump (citing `scripts/test-prisma5-upgrade.ts` as
  evidence the 5.x upgrade "was only prepared, not necessarily landed"), but both
  `package.json` files (root and `railway-gateway/`) already show `prisma@^6.19.2` installed
  today. The real jump is 6.19.2 → 7.8.0 — one major version crossed, not two. Proposed
  amendment for Session 2-1: scope the breaking-change audit and guide-reading to the 6→7
  boundary only (the Prisma 5→6 guide is moot since 6.x is already live); the plan document
  itself is unedited here — this is a proposal for the Advisor/Davin, not a self-applied
  change to plan strategy text.
- Evidence:
  - `npm view prisma@7.8.0 version` → `7.8.0`
  - root `package.json:91,165` → `"@prisma/client": "^6.19.2"`, `"prisma": "^6.19.2"`
  - `railway-gateway/package.json:26,44` → `"@prisma/client": "^6.19.2"`,
    `"prisma": "^6.19.2"`
- Approved by: n/a (technical, within bounds — version-existence check only; the
  major-version-count finding is a proposed amendment, not an applied one)

## F1 — OpenAPI coverage scope: PUBLIC vs internal-only (batch 1: operation domain)

- Status: RESOLVED (batch 1 only — auth, alerts, drawings, notifications, tier, user,
  market-data channel; batch 2/money domain and any later batches re-decide per their own
  routes)
- Session: 0-2 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: **All 34 routes across the 7 batch-1 domains are PUBLIC** — none excluded.
  Every handler is called directly by the browser client: 28 are gated by a NextAuth
  session check (`getServerSession(authOptions)` or `getSession()`, returning 401 without
  one), and the remaining 6 are the intentionally-unauthenticated pre-auth flows
  (`auth/[...nextauth]`, `auth/forgot-password`, `auth/register`,
  `auth/resend-verification`, `auth/reset-password`, `auth/verify-email`) which substitute
  CSRF-origin validation (`validateOrigin()`) or a mailed token for a session, since a
  logged-out user must be able to call them by design. No route in either group is
  service-to-service/internal — there is no separate internal caller anywhere in the
  codebase for these paths.
  - Include (all 34): `auth/[...nextauth]`, `auth/forgot-password`, `auth/register`,
    `auth/resend-verification`, `auth/reset-password`, `auth/track-login`,
    `auth/verify-email`; `alerts` (root), `alerts/[id]`, `alerts/line`, `alerts/line/[id]`;
    `drawings` (root), `drawings/[id]`; `notifications` (root), `notifications/[id]`,
    `notifications/[id]/read`; `tier/check/[symbol]`, `tier/combinations`, `tier/symbols`;
    `user/2fa/backup-codes`, `user/2fa/disable`, `user/2fa/setup`,
    `user/2fa/verify-setup`, `user/2fa/verify`, `user/account/deletion-cancel`,
    `user/account/deletion-confirm`, `user/account/deletion-request`,
    `user/login-history`, `user/password`, `user/preferences`, `user/profile`,
    `user/sessions/[id]`, `user/sessions`; `market-data/channel`.
  - Exclude: none.
- Evidence: read all 34 `route.ts` files directly (session/CSRF guard present in every
  one); `grep -rn "internal-only|internal only" app/api/{auth,alerts,drawings,
notifications,tier,user,market-data}` → zero matches;
  `migration-stack-analysis.md`'s FRONTEND appendix classifies `app/api/**` as one
  FRONTEND/Vercel-edge-function bucket with no per-route internal-only carve-out for any
  of these paths.
- Approved by: n/a (technical scope classification, within the order's explicit step-1
  instruction — no auth-semantics change, read-only classification of existing guards)

## Naming — OpenAPI spec file convention for Session 0-2 batch 1

- Status: RESOLVED (technical default — no Davin sign-off sought, since this choice
  explicitly does _not_ change the existing convention; see rationale)
- Session: 0-2 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: **Keep the existing `part-XX-<name>-openapi.yaml` numbering.** The 4
  files already in scope (`part-04-tier-system`, `part-05-authentication`,
  `part-11-alerts`, `part-15-notifications-realtime`) are updated/regenerated in place
  under their current filenames. The 3 domains with no prior spec (drawings, user,
  market-data channel) get the next sequential numbers: `docs/open-api-documents/archive/`
  already uses up to `part-20` (`part-20-sqlite-sync-postgresql-openapi.yaml`), so the new
  files are `part-21-drawings-openapi.yaml`, `part-22-user-account-openapi.yaml`,
  `part-23-market-data-channel-openapi.yaml`.
- Rationale: the order's own instruction requires Davin's sign-off only if _changing_ the
  existing numbering convention. Continuing it for the 3 new files is the lower-risk,
  no-escalation-needed default — it costs nothing (numbers are cheap) and avoids
  unilaterally deciding a repo-wide renaming scheme that would also implicitly affect the
  14 other in-scope-elsewhere `part-XX` files this session doesn't touch. If a cleaner
  per-domain scheme (e.g. `{domain}-openapi.yaml`) is wanted going forward, that's a
  proposal for Davin, not a self-applied change — flagged here for Session 0-3+ to raise.
- Evidence: `ls docs/open-api-documents/` (18 files, `part-02`…`part-19`) and
  `ls docs/open-api-documents/archive/` (`part-20-sqlite-sync-postgresql-openapi.yaml`) —
  confirms `part-21` is the next free number.
- Approved by: n/a (technical, within bounds — explicitly the non-convention-changing
  option; convention-changing alternative proposed above for Davin, not applied)

## F1 — OpenAPI coverage scope: PUBLIC vs internal-only (batch 2: money domain — CLOSES F1)

- Status: RESOLVED — F1 fully closed, both batches
- Session: 0-3 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: **103 live `app/api/**`routes exist** (fresh`find app/api -name route.ts`,
  confirmed twice — Session 0-2 and 0-3). Batch 1 (Session 0-2) accounted for 34. This
  session accounts for the remaining 69, closing F1 for the whole system:
  - **57 PUBLIC routes, spec'd**: checkout(2), subscription(2), invoices(1),
    payments/dlocal(7), admin(19 — see deviation note below), affiliate(8),
    disbursement(16, including the unauthenticated `health` endpoint), candles(1),
    config/affiliate(1).
  - **11 internal-only routes, spec'd with `security: []` + real mechanism documented**
    (not excluded from the OpenAPI docs — Davin's explicit direction this session,
    see consolidation entry below): webhooks/{stripe,dlocal,riseworks} (3, provider
    signature-verified, externally triggered — not called by our frontend) and all 8
    `cron/*` routes (`CRON_SECRET` bearer-gated, triggered by Vercel Cron infra, not
    by frontend or provider).
  - **1 excluded, logged with reason, not spec'd**: `test/seed` —
    `NODE_ENV`-gated to development/test only (`ALLOWED_ENVIRONMENTS`), 403s in any
    other environment; it's a test-harness fixture for E2E setup, not part of the
    real product API surface, so it gets no OpenAPI entry, but it is not silently
    dropped — logged here per the order's requirement.
  - 34 + 57 + 11 + 1 = 103. Every route accounted for.
- **Route-count drift (99 vs 103), reconciled:** the playbook's 99 is stale relative to
  the live codebase; no single missing/extra route explains the gap precisely, but the
  breakdown above is independently verified against `find app/api -name route.ts` twice.
  Treat 103 as authoritative going forward, matching L8's "verify against live state,
  don't trust an old written number."
- **Deviation from playbook wording:** the playbook scoped this session to
  `admin/affiliates` (10 of 19 `admin/**` routes). Extended to the full `admin` domain
  (19 routes) because 9 routes (`analytics`, `api-usage`, `error-logs`, `users`,
  `fraud-alerts`×2, `codes/{code}/cancel`, `commissions/pay`, `settings/affiliate`)
  would otherwise be left uncovered by any session, and this order's own "Done when"
  requires every `app/api/**` route accounted for. Small, in-bounds, no live code
  touched — not escalated.
- **Two findings surfaced (read-only — documented, not fixed):**
  1. `app/api/cron/daily-maintenance/route.ts`'s own docstring claims it consolidates
     `expire-codes` + `check-expiring-subscriptions` + `downgrade-expired-subscriptions`,
     "reducing Vercel cron count from 4 to 2" — but `vercel.json` still independently
     schedules all 8 cron routes, including all 3 of the ones it claims to supersede.
     Production may be running duplicate maintenance work daily (idempotency of the
     individual handlers not verified). Documented in the specs (part-12, part-17);
     flagging here for Davin's attention — this is a live-code question, not a docs one.
  2. `app/api/candles/[symbol]/route.ts` builds its PostgreSQL table name via string
     interpolation (`` `${symbol}_${timeframe}` ``) directly into the SQL query, not a
     parameterized identifier (Postgres doesn't support identifiers as bind params).
     Input is constrained upstream (fixed `timeframe` enum, lowercased `symbol` path
     segment) but this pattern is worth a dedicated security-review look — out of this
     session's scope to fix, flagging for Davin.
- Evidence: all 5 batch-2 domain specs + the `part-23` extension read/regenerated
  directly against every live handler this session (see migration-stack-analysis.md
  and the order's Deviations section for the full file list); route counts
  cross-verified via `find app/api -name route.ts` and per-domain `find` counts;
  `vercel.json` read directly for the cron-scheduling finding.
- Approved by: n/a (technical scope classification within the order's explicit
  instructions) for the classification itself; the admin-domain-expansion deviation is
  logged per protocol, not separately escalated (small, in-bounds). The file-consolidation
  approach (below) was explicitly approved by Davin mid-session.

## Spec consolidation — batch-2 OpenAPI files (part-12/14/17/18/19)

- Status: RESOLVED (Davin-approved mid-session)
- Session: 0-3 · Date: 2026-07-17
- Decision: the 5 pre-existing "likely batch-2" spec files
  (`part-12-ecommerce-billing`, `part-14-admin-dashboard`, `part-17-affiliate`,
  `part-18-dlocal-payment`, `part19-disbursement`) turned out to overlap heavily and
  inconsistently — e.g. `payments/dlocal/*` and `webhooks/dlocal` were duplicated in
  both part-12 and part-18; `admin/fraud-alerts` in both part-14 and part-18;
  `admin/affiliates/*` (9 sub-paths) in both part-14 and part-17; `checkout/*` in both
  part-12 and part-17; cron routes scattered redundantly across part-17/18/19.
  `part-17` additionally had a **systematic bug**: every path was missing the `/api`
  prefix (`/checkout` instead of `/api/checkout`, etc.) — wrong against every live
  route, not just individually stale fields.
  Presented three options to Davin (consolidate into clean non-overlapping files /
  patch in place and leave overlap / decide per-file); **Davin chose full
  consolidation**. Each of the 5 files is now the single sole owner of its domain
  (see each file's own `info.description` for its exact route list and what moved
  where); no route is documented in more than one file; the `/api` prefix bug in
  part-17 is fixed. `part-16-utilities-infrastructure` was left untouched — it
  documents `/internal/health` + `/internal/metrics`, paths that don't correspond to
  any `app/api/**` route at all, so it was never actually a batch-2 candidate despite
  CLAUDE.md's "5 existing specs" guess (there were 6 real candidates, one irrelevant).
  `candles/[symbol]` (an uncovered leftover domain, not in any batch's named scope) was
  added to `part-23-market-data-channel-openapi.yaml` (written Session 0-2) rather than
  given its own single-route file, since it's topically the same market-data area.
- Evidence: cross-file path-overlap grep before and after (zero duplicates remain,
  confirmed via `grep -E '^  /' <all 5 files> | sort | uniq -d` → empty); all 5 files
  - the part-23 extension parse as valid YAML (`js-yaml`, loaded via its resolved
    `.pnpm` store path — `require()`-by-bare-name fails here the same way L7 describes
    for `glob`; see LESSONS-LEARNED). Every path in every file was verified against its
    live handler by the executing agent, not copied from the old spec unverified —
    dozens of field-level corrections were found and fixed (see each file's
    `info.description` for its own list); this is the same class of error L8 warned
    about, now confirmed to be widespread across the batch-2 spec set, not isolated to
    part-04/part-11.
- Approved by: Davin (explicit choice among 3 presented options, mid-session
  2026-07-17 — this was a material, boundary-touching decision affecting the file
  inventory, correctly escalated per the Autonomy & Deviation clause rather than
  decided unilaterally).
