The job failed due to declaration conflicts with the name dynamic in app/(dashboard)/charts/[symbol]/[timeframe]/page.tsx:

- error TS2395: Individual declarations in merged declaration 'dynamic' must be all exported or all local.
- error TS2440: Import declaration conflicts with local declaration of 'dynamic'.
- error TS2448 / TS2454: Block-scoped variable 'dynamic' used before its declaration.

Cause and Solution:
You have both import dynamic from 'next/dynamic' (line 1) and export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' (line 35). TypeScript does not allow merging local and exported declarations with the same name. This also causes import vs. local name conflicts and “used before declaration” errors.

To fix:

- Rename the exported variable dynamic to something else, or move the export to a different file (like route.ts/route.js).
- The recommended Next.js v13+ way to force dynamic rendering is to export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' from a separate file (e.g., route.js or page.js/ts) or place this directive at the top of your file, outside the component, but ensure it does not conflict with imports.

Example solution for page.tsx:

```tsx
// 1. Rename the export if you want to keep both
export const dynamicType = 'force-dynamic';

// OR

// 2. Move this export to a separate file (e.g., route.ts) in the same directory
// And remove `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` from this page file.

import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
// ...rest of your code as is.
```

This will resolve the naming conflict and the build will pass.
