The build is failing due to conflicting declarations of dynamic in app/(dashboard)/charts/[symbol]/[timeframe]/page.tsx. You have:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
//...
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

TypeScript doesn't allow merging an imported symbol with a local/exported variable of the same name. You must rename the export or use a different name for the import. Here’s how you can fix it:

Change your export on line 35:

```tsx
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

To:

```tsx
export const dynamicMode = 'force-dynamic';
```

Or, alternatively, rename the import:

```tsx
import nextDynamic from 'next/dynamic';
```

And update all uses of dynamic to nextDynamic:

```tsx
const TradingChart = nextDynamic( ...
```

Be sure the import and export use different names.

Refer to page.tsx in the f815bfb6 commit for further context.
