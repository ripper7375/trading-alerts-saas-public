The job failed because one or more of the following jobs failed: Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, or Production Build Check. According to the workflow in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: f815bfb662378f1ffa00927aa1c450eb5102942b), the test-summary job will exit with code 1 if any of those jobs do not succeed.

To resolve the issue:

1. Check which job(s) failed by reviewing the results for:
   - unit-and-component-tests
   - integration-tests
   - build-check

2. Address the root cause in the failing job. For example:
   - For test failures, review test output and fix the code or tests.
   - For lint/type errors, run pnpm run lint or pnpm run type-check locally and fix issues.
   - For build failures, ensure the build succeeds with pnpm run build.
   - For bundle size errors, reduce bundle size according to the thresholds in the build-check job:
     - <340MB: target, >370MB: warning, >450MB: critical, >500MB: panic/hard fail.

3. If skipping jobs is intended (as shown in your logs), remove or adjust any skip logic to ensure required steps are executed.

Example fix for a failing build due to bundle size (in Next.js config or to optimize dependencies):

```js
// next.config.js
module.exports = {
  // Enable webpack chunking, analyze, or other bundle optimizations
};
```

After fixing the underlying job failure, commit and push your changes to trigger the workflow again. Full details of the workflow logic can be reviewed in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: f815bfb662378f1ffa00927aa1c450eb5102942b).
