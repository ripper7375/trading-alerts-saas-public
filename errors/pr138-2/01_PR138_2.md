The error is caused by the line export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'; in app/(dashboard)/charts/[symbol]/[timeframe]/page.tsx. Next.js requires that all individual declarations merged under the name dynamic are either all exported or all local. In this file, the dynamic import (import dynamic from 'next/dynamic') and export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic' are clashing.

To fix this, rename the exported variable dynamic to something else (e.g., export const dynamicRendering = 'force-dynamic';), or remove it if it's not strictly necessary. For your case, renaming is safest.

Update line 35 from:

```ts
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

to:

```ts
export const dynamicRendering = 'force-dynamic';
```

This will resolve the conflicting declaration and allow the build to succeed. See the file here for reference (ref: f815bfb662378f1ffa00927aa1c450eb5102942b).
