The build failed due to a TypeScript error on line 35 in app/(dashboard)/charts/[symbol]/[timeframe]/page.tsx:

```
Type error: Individual declarations in merged declaration 'dynamic' must be all exported or all local.
```

You have both a default import of dynamic from next/dynamic and a local exported const named dynamic:

```tsx
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
...
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
```

To fix this, rename the exported dynamic variable to avoid the naming conflict, for example:

```tsx
export const dynamicRendering = 'force-dynamic';
```

and update any Next.js configuration or usage that expects export const dynamic. Alternatively, remove the local export if it's not needed.

Relevant file: app/(dashboard)/charts/[symbol]/[timeframe]/page.tsx (ref: f815bfb662378f1ffa00927aa1c450eb5102942b)
