The main reason for the failing job is that the environment variable CRON_SECRET is not configured. The code in app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts expects CRON_SECRET to be set for authentication (see lines 21–24), and when it’s missing, it logs "CRON_SECRET not configured" and returns a 500 error:

```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env['CRON_SECRET'];
if (!cronSecret) {
  console.error('CRON_SECRET not configured');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Cron job not configured' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

**Solution:**  
Add the CRON_SECRET environment variable to the workflow.  
In your GitHub repository settings, add a new secret (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret), call it CRON_SECRET, and set its value.

Then, update your workflow at [.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/c2455944d11ea719cd177f539b89aa9643f36b47/.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml) to include this secret in jobs that need it. For example, add it to your test job:

```yaml
env:
  CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}
```

**How to apply:**

1. Add CRON_SECRET to repository secrets.
2. Update the relevant jobs in your workflow YAML file to include the CRON_SECRET variable in the env section.

This configuration will resolve the missing CRON_SECRET error and allow the cron-related tests to authenticate successfully.
