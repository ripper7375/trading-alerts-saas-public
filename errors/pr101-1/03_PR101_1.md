The job failed because the workflow’s "Test Summary" step is configured to fail if any of the “unit-and-component-tests,” “integration-tests,” or “build-check” jobs report a failure. The message “❌ One or more test jobs failed” means at least one dependent job didn’t succeed.

Solution:

1. Identify which core job—unit/component tests, integration tests, or build check—failed.
2. Review the logs for the failing job to find the specific error.
3. Fix the failure at its source (e.g., failing test, build size, or dependency error).

Tip: Check each job in your workflow run for the word “failure.” The relevant job in your tests.yml file is determined by these lines:

```yaml
154|  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Address the reason for failure in the corresponding job. For example, if a test is failing, review and fix the problematic test or source code. If the build job failed due to bundle size, reduce the output of your Next.js build.
