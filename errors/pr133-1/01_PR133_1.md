The failing job is caused by a linting error in app/api/test/seed/route.ts:

'request' is defined but never used. Allowed unused args must match /^_/u.  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars

Solution:
Rename the unused request parameter in app/api/test/seed/route.ts to _request. For example, if your function starts like this:

export async function GET(request: Request) {

Change it to:

export async function GET(_request: Request) {

This satisfies the linter rule and should resolve the job failure.
