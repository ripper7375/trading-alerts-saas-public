The job failed with the message: “❌ One or more test jobs failed” and exited with code 1. This is triggered in the test-summary job, which contains a step to fail if any of unit, integration, or build check jobs fail.

From the logs, both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were skipped, which indicates missing dependencies: their corresponding jobs rely on needs.unit-and-component-tests.result, needs.integration-tests.result, and needs.build-check.result outputs.

Solution:

1. Ensure that all jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) either run and complete or are properly skipped for legitimate reasons.
2. If you want the summary to only fail when jobs were actually run and failed (not skipped), update the condition in the test-summary step. Replace:
   ```yaml
   needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
   needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
   needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
   ```
   with:
   ```yaml
   (needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure') ||
   (needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure') ||
   (needs.build-check.result == 'failure')
   ```

   Also, for jobs skipped by design, ensure their outputs do not trigger a false negative in summary.

3. If jobs are skipped using conditionals elsewhere, consider updating the workflow to either output a neutral result or adjust the summary/failure check logic to account for skipped jobs:
   ```yaml
   if: |
     (needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure') ||
     (needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure') ||
     (needs.build-check.result == 'failure')
   ```

4. Check if required jobs are being skipped by a workflow filter or path/branch condition, and adjust trigger conditions if appropriate.

Summary: Adjust your test-summary fail step to account for skipped jobs, or ensure all jobs complete as expected to avoid this summary failure.
