The job failed due to an ESLint error in app/api/test/seed/route.ts: "'request' is defined but never used. Allowed unused args must match /^_/u." To fix this, rename the unused request parameter to _request in the function definition. This will satisfy the linting rule and allow the build to pass.

Example code update:
```typescript
export async function SOME_HANDLER(_request: Request) {
  // ...rest of your handler code
}
```
