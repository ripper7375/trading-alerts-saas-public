I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The build is failing due to an incorrect import in `lib/auth/auth-options.ts`. The error indicates that `Provider` is not a valid named export from `next-auth`.

**Problem:**
Line 4 attempts to import `Provider` as a type from `next-auth`, but this export doesn't exist in the module:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

**Solution:**
Remove the `Provider` import since it's declared but never used in the file. Update line 4 to:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

The `Provider` type isn't needed anywhere in this file - you're already using specific provider imports like `GoogleProvider`, `TwitterProvider`, etc. from `next-auth/providers/*`, which is the correct approach.

**Updated code for lines 1-10:**

```typescript
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
import type { Account, User } from 'next-auth';
import type { Adapter, AdapterUser } from 'next-auth/adapters';
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google';
import LinkedInProvider from 'next-auth/providers/linkedin';
import TwitterProvider from 'next-auth/providers/twitter';
```

This change will resolve both TypeScript errors:

- TS2614: Module has no exported member 'Provider'
- TS6133: 'Provider' is declared but never used
