I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The ESLint error is on **line 4** of `lib/auth/auth-options.ts`. The `Provider` type is imported but never used in the file.

**Fix:** Remove the unused `Provider` import from line 4.

### Code Change

Replace line 4:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

With:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

The `Provider` type was imported but isn't referenced anywhere in the code. The file uses specific provider functions (`GoogleProvider`, `TwitterProvider`, `LinkedInProvider`, `CredentialsProvider`) rather than the generic `Provider` type, so this import can be safely removed.
