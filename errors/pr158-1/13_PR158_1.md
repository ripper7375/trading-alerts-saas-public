I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The TypeScript error is caused by an incorrect import on line 4. The `Provider` type doesn't exist as a named export in `next-auth`. Additionally, line 5 imports `Provider` types from providers, not the base package.

**The Fix:**

Remove `Provider` from the import on line 4:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

The complete updated import section should look like this:

```typescript
import { PrismaAdapter } from '@next-auth/prisma-adapter';
import bcrypt from 'bcryptjs';
import jwt from 'jsonwebtoken';
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
import type { Account, User } from 'next-auth';
import type { Adapter, AdapterUser } from 'next-auth/adapters';
import CredentialsProvider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials';
import GoogleProvider from 'next-auth/providers/google';
import LinkedInProvider from 'next-auth/providers/linkedin';
import TwitterProvider from 'next-auth/providers/twitter';
```

**Why this works:**

- The `Provider` type is not exported from the main `next-auth` module
- You're already importing the specific provider functions (GoogleProvider, CredentialsProvider, etc.) which are what you actually use in the code
- The `NextAuthOptions` type is sufficient for typing your `authOptions` configuration

This change will resolve both TypeScript errors:

- `TS2614`: Module has no exported member 'Provider'
- `TS6133`: 'Provider' is declared but never used
