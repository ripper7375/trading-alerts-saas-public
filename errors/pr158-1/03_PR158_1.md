I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The build is failing due to an **ESLint error** - the `Provider` type is imported on line 4 but never used in the file.

### Fix

Remove `Provider` from the import statement on line 4:

**Current code:**

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

**Fixed code:**

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

This will resolve the linting error: `'Provider' is defined but never used.  Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u.`

Alternatively, if you need to keep the import for future use, you can prefix it with an underscore to indicate it's intentionally unused:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider as _Provider } from 'next-auth';
```
