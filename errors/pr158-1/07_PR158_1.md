I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The TypeScript compilation is failing because `Provider` is not a valid export from the `next-auth` module. The error occurs on **line 4** of `lib/auth/auth-options.ts`.

### The Problem

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

The `Provider` type is being imported but:

1. It's not exported by `next-auth` (causing TS2614)
2. It's never actually used in the code (causing TS6133)

### The Fix

Remove `type Provider` from the import statement on line 4:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

The file doesn't use the `Provider` type anywhere, so it's safe to remove. The actual provider instances (`GoogleProvider`, `CredentialsProvider`, etc.) are imported separately from their respective modules on lines 7-10, which is the correct approach.

**Updated line 4:**

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

This will resolve both TypeScript errors and allow your CI build to pass.
