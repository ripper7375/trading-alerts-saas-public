The job is failing due to an ESLint error in lib/auth/auth-options.ts: `'Provider' is defined but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^_/u.  @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` at line 4 ([code reference](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/a6f4b0673aba082b3079de6a79ccb08ea2f846dc/lib/auth/auth-options.ts)).

**Solution:**  
Remove the unused import `Provider` from this line:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

Change it to:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

This resolves the linting error by eliminating the unused variable, allowing your build to pass.
