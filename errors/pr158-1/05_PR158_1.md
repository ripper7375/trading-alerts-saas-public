I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me first get the job logs to understand what went wrong. ## Solution

The build is failing due to an **ESLint error**: the `Provider` type import on line 4 is defined but never used in the code.

**Issue:**

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions, type Provider } from 'next-auth';
```

The `Provider` type is imported but not used anywhere in the file, violating the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule.

**Fix:**

Remove the unused `Provider` type from the import statement on line 4:

```typescript
import { type NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth';
```

This will resolve the linting error and allow the build to complete successfully.
