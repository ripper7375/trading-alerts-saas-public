I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job failed due to **type check** and **linting** failures. Let me examine the workflow and the earlier steps to identify the specific issues: ## Solution

The security checks workflow is failing because **two checks are not passing**:

1. **TypeScript Type Check** - Failed
2. **ESLint Linting** - Failed

### To fix this issue:

**1. Fix TypeScript type errors:**
Run the type check locally to see the specific errors:

```bash
pnpm run type-check
```

Then fix all TypeScript type errors that are reported.

**2. Fix linting errors:**
Run ESLint locally and fix the issues:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

You can also try auto-fixing many lint errors with:

```bash
pnpm run lint --fix
```

### Quick verification:

Before pushing, run both commands locally to ensure they pass:

```bash
pnpm run type-check && pnpm run lint
```

The workflow summary job is correctly reporting that type-check and lint jobs failed (lines 201-210 in the workflow file). Once you resolve the TypeScript type errors and ESLint issues, the security checks will pass.
