I'll analyze the failing job to find the solution for you. The job logs show this is a summary job that failed because "one or more test jobs failed". Let me get the workflow file to see the job dependencies and then identify which actual test job failed: The `test-summary` job is failing because one or more of its dependent jobs (`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, or `build-check`) failed. The job correctly reports this failure at lines 169-176.

To identify which specific job failed, you need to check the results of the upstream jobs in the workflow run. The `test-summary` job is designed to aggregate results and fail if any dependency fails.

**The issue:** One or more of these jobs failed:

- `unit-and-component-tests`
- `integration-tests`
- `build-check`

**Solution:**

Check the logs of each dependent job to find the actual failure. You can view them in the GitHub Actions UI for this workflow run, or I can help investigate specific jobs if you provide their job IDs.

However, if you want the `test-summary` job to show more informative output even when jobs are skipped or cancelled, you can update the workflow to handle those states:

```yaml
- name: Check test results
  run: |
    echo "## Test Summary" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    echo "" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

    # Unit & Component Tests
    if [[ "${{ needs.unit-and-component-tests.result }}" == "success" ]]; then
      echo "- ✅ Unit & Component Tests: passed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    elif [[ "${{ needs.unit-and-component-tests.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then
      echo "- ❌ Unit & Component Tests: failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    else
      echo "- ⏭️ Unit & Component Tests: ${{ needs.unit-and-component-tests.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    fi

    # Integration Tests
    if [[ "${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" == "success" ]]; then
      echo "- ✅ Integration Tests: passed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    elif [[ "${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then
      echo "- ❌ Integration Tests: failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    else
      echo "- ⏭️ Integration Tests: ${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    fi

    # Build Check
    if [[ "${{ needs.build-check.result }}" == "success" ]]; then
      echo "- ✅ Build Check: passed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    elif [[ "${{ needs. build-check.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then
      echo "- ❌ Build Check: failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    else
      echo "- ⏭️ Build Check: ${{ needs.build-check.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
    fi
```

This will provide clearer feedback about which jobs actually failed versus being skipped or cancelled.
