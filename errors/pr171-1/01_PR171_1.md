The job failed due to flake8 E501 errors: lines in mt5-service/app/services/indicator_reader.py are too long.

To fix this, break lines 189, 190, and 191 so that no line exceeds 88 characters.

Here’s a targeted fix for the relevant section:

Original (lines 189–191):

```python
'peak_1': peak_1 is not None and len(peak_1) > 0 if peak_1 is not None else False,
'peak_2': peak_2 is not None and len(peak_2) > 0 if peak_2 is not None else False,
'bottom_1': bottom_1 is not None and len(bottom_1) > 0 if bottom_1 is not None else False,
```

Suggested replacement:

```python
'peak_1': (
    peak_1 is not None and len(peak_1) > 0 if peak_1 is not None else False
),
'peak_2': (
    peak_2 is not None and len(peak_2) > 0 if peak_2 is not None else False
),
'bottom_1': (
    bottom_1 is not None and len(bottom_1) > 0 if bottom_1 is not None else False
),
```

After making these changes, the job should pass the flake8 checks. See the lines in question here (ref: 934cf76a85a20d50633bc30f810a35c7a3726dc7):
