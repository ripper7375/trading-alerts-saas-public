I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. Now let me examine the test file to understand the failure: ## Solution for Failing Test

The test is failing at line 531 in `__tests__/lib/cache/indicator-cache.test.ts`. The test expects `CACHE_TTL.M5` to be `300`, but it's receiving a different value.

**Root Cause:**
The test is validating that the `CACHE_TTL` constant from `@/lib/constants/business-rules` has specific values, but the actual values don't match the expected ones.

**Fix:**

You need to check and update the `CACHE_TTL` values in your constants file. The test expects these specific values (in seconds):

```typescript
// In lib/constants/business-rules.ts or wherever CACHE_TTL is defined
export const CACHE_TTL = {
  M5: 300, // 5 minutes
  M15: 900, // 15 minutes
  M30: 1800, // 30 minutes
  H1: 3600, // 1 hour
  H2: 7200, // 2 hours
  H4: 14400, // 4 hours
  H8: 28800, // 8 hours
  H12: 43200, // 12 hours
  D1: 86400, // 24 hours
};
```

**Verify the file:**

Check the current values in your `lib/constants/business-rules. ts` file and ensure they match the expected values above. The failing assertion suggests that at least `CACHE_TTL.M5` is not `300`, which is breaking the test.
