I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. Let me get the test file to understand the failing test better: ## Solution for Failing Test

The test failure is in `__tests__/lib/cache/indicator-cache.test.ts` at line 531. The test expects `CACHE_TTL.H12` to equal `43200` (12 hours in seconds), but it's receiving a different value.

**Location:** [`__tests__/lib/cache/indicator-cache.test.ts:531`](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/934cf76a85a20d50633bc30f810a35c7a3726dc7/__tests__/lib/cache/indicator-cache.test.ts#L531)

**Issue:** The test is validating that the `CACHE_TTL` constants match expected values. The H12 timeframe constant is not set to 43200 seconds.

**Fix:** You need to check the `CACHE_TTL` constant definition in your business rules file and ensure `H12` is set to the correct value:

```typescript
// In @/lib/constants/business-rules (or wherever CACHE_TTL is defined)
export const CACHE_TTL = {
  M5: 300, // 5 minutes
  M15: 900, // 15 minutes
  M30: 1800, // 30 minutes
  H1: 3600, // 1 hour
  H2: 7200, // 2 hours
  H4: 14400, // 4 hours
  H8: 28800, // 8 hours
  H12: 43200, // 12 hours - ensure this is set correctly
  D1: 86400, // 24 hours
};
```

**Alternative:** If the test expectation is wrong and H12 should have a different TTL value, update line 538 in the test file to match your intended value:

```typescript
expect(CACHE_TTL.H12).toBe(43200); // Change 43200 to the correct value
```

Check your `@/lib/constants/business-rules` file to see the current value of `CACHE_TTL.H12` and either update the constant or the test expectation accordingly.
