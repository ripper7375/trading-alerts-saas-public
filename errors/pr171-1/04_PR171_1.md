I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. This job is a summary job that failed because one or more upstream test jobs failed. Let me check the pull request to identify which specific test job failed. The job is failing because it's a summary job that depends on other test jobs, and one or more of those upstream jobs failed. The logs show:

```
❌ One or more test jobs failed
exit 1
```

This is a status check job that aggregates results from other jobs in the workflow. The actual failure is in one of the dependent jobs, not this one.

**Solution:**

You need to check the other jobs in the same workflow run to identify which specific test job failed. Look for:

- Unit tests job
- Integration tests job
- Build check job
- Or other test jobs defined in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

To get the workflow file and see the job dependencies:
