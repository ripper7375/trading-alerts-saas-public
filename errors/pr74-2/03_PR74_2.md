The failing job 58965380379 is caused by the "Build Check" step reporting a failure. According to the workflow in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 4c995a0f8323f4b2e549a990249ac3c418bc94fc), the build check performs a "pnpm run build" command for your Next.js app and then checks the bundled output size in the .next/ directory. If the size exceeds 340MB, the build fails.

Solution:

- Reduce the size of your Next.js production bundle so it is less than 340MB. You can do this by:
  - Removing unused dependencies.
  - Dynamically importing large components/pages.
  - Splitting code with dynamic imports (React.lazy or Next.js dynamic imports).
  - Ensuring that test or development-only dependencies are not included in the production build.
  - Running pnpm run analyze locally (after adding next-bundle-analyzer) to identify what increases bundle size.

You can find the bundle size check logic here:

```bash
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 340 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 340MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Lowering the bundle size below 340MB will ensure the build check passes. If you want to increase the allowed bundle size, you can update the threshold in the workflow step, but this is not recommended unless truly necessary.
