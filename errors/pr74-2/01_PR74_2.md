The job failed because the Next.js production bundle size is 341MB, exceeding the workflow threshold of 340MB set in the build step.

To resolve this issue:

- Reduce your production bundle size below 340MB. Review the .next directory contents and remove unnecessary modules, assets, or large dependencies.
- Use Next.js tools such as next/image, next/dynamic (for code-splitting), and analyze with pnpm run analyze or next build --analyze to identify large modules.
- If reducing the bundle is not immediately possible and the increase is intentional, you can increase the threshold in the workflow file (.github/workflows/tests.yml, line 131):

```yaml
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 340 ]; then
echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 340MB"
exit 1
fi
```

Change 340 to a higher threshold as needed, but be cautious—large bundles may impact app performance and deployment limits.
