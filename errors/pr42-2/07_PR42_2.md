The job failed due to this step in the test-summary job:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.build-check.result != 'success'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

This step triggers if any of the previous jobs did not succeed. From the logs, both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were skipped, which caused this summary job to fail.

Solution:

- Ensure that required jobs ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", "build-check") are enabled and not skipped due to branch filters or workflow triggers in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: b6932abf38f80655e948a94f71eb52cdfb7fad97).
- Adjust branch filters (lines 4–7) if your working branch is not included:

  ```yaml
  on:
    push:
      branches: [main, develop, claude/**]
    pull_request:
      branches: [main, develop]
  ```

  Add your branch if needed.

- If you want to allow the workflow to succeed even when jobs are skipped, modify the "Fail if any test failed" step's conditional to ignore skipped results:
  ```yaml
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  ```

Choose the option that fits your use case: either enable skipped jobs or adjust the conditional to only fail on actual failures, not skips.
