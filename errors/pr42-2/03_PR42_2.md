The failing job is caused by this error:

Type error: Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.

This occurs in app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts at line 86, during execution of prisma.systemConfig.findMany.

Solution:
Make sure the Prisma schema defines a systemConfig model and that you have generated the appropriate Prisma Client. In your codebase, ensure your import for prisma is correct (it is imported from @/lib/db/prisma), but most importantly, check the schema.prisma file for a model definition like:

```prisma
model SystemConfig {
  key        String   @id
  value      String
  updatedBy  String?
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
  // ... other fields
}
```

If this model is missing, define it and then run:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

If the model exists but under a different name, replace systemConfig with the correct model name in your code. For example, if your model is System_Config, use prisma.system_Config.

Once you add the model and regenerate Prisma Client, the error will be resolved. See the affected code here (ref b6932abf38f80655e948a94f71eb52cdfb7fad97):
