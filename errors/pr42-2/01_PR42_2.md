The failure is due to a TypeScript error in app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts at line 86:

Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.

Solution:
Your Prisma schema doesn't define a model named systemConfig, but your code uses prisma.systemConfig. In Prisma, model names are case-sensitive and typically use PascalCase (e.g., SystemConfig). Check your Prisma schema file for the correct model name. For example, if your model is defined as model SystemConfig { ... } in schema.prisma, you should use prisma.systemConfig (which Prisma auto-converts), but ensure that your generated Prisma client contains this property.

Check the spelling and case in both schema and generated client. If your model is named SystemConfig with a capital S, regenerate your Prisma client:

npx prisma generate

If the model name is correct but Prisma Client is missing the property, try re-running the Prisma code generation and restart your development server.

Example:
If your Prisma schema contains:
model SystemConfig { ... }

Make sure you're importing and using Prisma like this:
import { prisma } from '@/lib/db/prisma';
// use prisma.systemConfig.findMany(...)

If your model uses a different name or casing, update the usage in route.ts to match.

Summary of changes:

- Validate the model name and casing in your Prisma schema (schema.prisma)
- Run npx prisma generate after any schema changes
- Ensure prisma.systemConfig exists in the generated client

Once this is fixed, the error will be resolved and your workflow/build will not fail at this step.
