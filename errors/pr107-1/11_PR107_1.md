The failing job 59028217934 failed because one or more required test jobs in the workflow did not succeed. The final step in the test-summary job checks the result of the following jobs:

- unit-and-component-tests
- integration-tests
- build-check

If any of these jobs fail, the summary step triggers an explicit failure with exit 1.

To solve this issue:

1. Check which of the dependent jobs failed in this workflow. The failure message alone does not specify this; review the results of unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check in this workflow run for specific errors.
2. Address the specific cause in the failed job:
   - For unit-and-component-tests, check TypeScript, ESLint, or test failures.
   - For integration-tests, review integration test output.
   - For build-check, make sure the Next.js production build and bundle size check passes.

If needed, you can temporarily add debugging output or artifacts to the steps to gather more detail during CI runs. After fixing the root cause in the failed test job, the summary job will report success automatically.
