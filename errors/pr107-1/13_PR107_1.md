The job failed because the dependency version for swr is mismatched between package.json and package-lock.json:

- package.json: "swr": "^2.3.8"
- package-lock.json: "swr": "^2.2.4"

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile by running the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will synchronize package-lock.json with the specifiers in your package.json. After that, commit the updated lockfile.

If using npm, use:

```bash
npm install
```

Once done, push the updated lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml or package-lock.json) to the repository. This will resolve the lockfile and manifest mismatch and allow the pipeline to proceed.
