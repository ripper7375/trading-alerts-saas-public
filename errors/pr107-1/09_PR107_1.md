The failing job is caused by a dependency version mismatch: the lockfile lists swr as ^2.2.4, but package.json specifies ^2.3.8.

**Solution:**  
Update your pnpm-lock.yaml to match the desired swr version in package.json.

**How to fix:**

1. Run:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will update the lockfile to match your package.json.

2. Commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml.

**Why:**  
Your [package.json](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e38d0530e8ff6/package.json) lists swr as "^2.3.8", but [pnpm-lock.yaml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e8ff6/pnpm-lock.yaml) lists the older specifier, causing the lockfile integrity check to fail. Synchronizing them resolves the job failure.
