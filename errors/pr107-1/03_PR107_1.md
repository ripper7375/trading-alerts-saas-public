The failing job reports a dependency version mismatch between your lockfile and package.json for the swr package:

- swr in lockfile: ^2.2.4
- swr in package.json: ^2.3.8

Solution: To resolve this, update your lockfile to match the package.json manifest.

Recommended steps:

1. Run your package manager's install/update, which will reconcile the lockfile:
   - For npm:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - For yarn:
     ```sh
     yarn install
     ```
2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).

If swr@^2.3.8 is your intended version, confirm that this is reflected in both package.json and your lockfile. If not, update package.json to match your desired version and repeat the steps above.

Code suggestion (example if using npm):

```sh
npm install swr@^2.3.8
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix: synchronize lockfile with package.json for swr"
```

After making these changes, re-run your workflow; the job should pass.
