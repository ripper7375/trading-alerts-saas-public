The failure is due to a dependency mismatch between package.json and package-lock.json for swr:

- package.json specifies: "swr": "^2.3.8"
- package-lock.json specifies: "swr": "^2.2.4"

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile to match the package.json dependency specifiers. Run:

```sh
npm install
```

This will update package-lock.json to align swr with "^2.3.8" as required by package.json.

If you're using a strict CI, you may need to commit the updated package-lock.json. You can review the relevant files here:

- [package.json (ref: 36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e38d0530e8ff6)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e38d0530e8ff6/package.json)
- [package-lock.json (ref: 36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e38d0530e8ff6)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/36af69c1543472405cec1be0690e38d0530e8ff6/package-lock.json)

After updating, re-run your workflow to ensure the job passes.
