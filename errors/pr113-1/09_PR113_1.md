The job failed due to several TypeScript errors in your codebase. The major issues are:

1. **PrismaClient does not have property 'userSession':**
   - Error: `Property 'userSession' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.`
   - Cause: In your Prisma schema (`[ref]/prisma/schema.prisma`), the model is named `UserSession` (capital 'U'), and Prisma auto-generates the client property as `userSession` (lowercase 'u') for the model.
   - Solution: This usage is actually correct and matches the generated client API. However, ensure your Prisma Client is generated after any schema changes. Run:
     ```sh
     npx prisma generate
     ```
     If the error persists, check for mismatches in Prisma Client import.

2. **Optional Type Assignments:**
   - Error: `Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.`
   - Solution: Add a fallback for possibly undefined values, e.g.:
     ```typescript
     const x: string = possiblyUndefinedValue || '';
     ```
     Find locations like `lib/auth/session-tracker.ts(129,18)` and add the fallback.

3. **Implicit 'any' type:**
   - Error: `Parameter 'session' implicitly has an 'any' type.`
   - Solution: Explicitly type function parameters:
     ```typescript
     const session: SessionType = ...
     ```
     Define a proper type or interface for these parameters.

4. **Unused variable warnings:**
   - Error: `'signOut' is declared but its value is never read.`
   - Solution: Remove any unused imports/variables from `app/(dashboard)/settings/account/page.tsx` (line 4) and `app/api/user/sessions/[id]/route.ts` (line 46).

5. **Codecov Warning:**
   - `None of the following appear to exist as files: ./coverage/lcov.info`
   - Solution: Ensure your tests are generating coverage files before uploading to Codecov.

**Sample code for Type fixes:**

```typescript
// Assign fallback for undefined
const currentSessionToken: string = session.currentSessionToken || '';

// Add parameter typing
return sessions.map((session: UserSession) => ({
  // your mapping here
}));
```

**Summary of fixes:**

- Run `npx prisma generate` after any Prisma schema change.
- Fix all variables possibly undefined by providing defaults.
- Provide explicit types for all function parameters.
- Remove any unused variables or imports.
- Ensure code coverage is configured in your test setup.

After making these changes, commit and push again to rerun the jobs.
