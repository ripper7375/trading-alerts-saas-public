The job failed because the class bg-muted-foreground/30 does not exist in your Tailwind CSS setup. This class is used in your globals.css file, for example:

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  @apply bg-muted-foreground/30 rounded-full;
}
```

To resolve this:

1. If you want a background color based on your --muted-foreground variable with opacity, use Tailwind’s built-in utilities or define the class yourself:
   - Replace bg-muted-foreground/30 with an inline color style using CSS variables and the desired opacity:
     ```css
     ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
       background-color: rgb(
         var(--muted-foreground-rgb),
         0.3
       ); /* Ensure --muted-foreground-rgb is defined as comma-separated RGB values */
       border-radius: 9999px;
     }
     ```
   - Or, if you want to use Tailwind, create a custom utility via @layer utilities in your CSS:
     ```css
     @layer utilities {
       .bg-muted-foreground-30 {
         background-color: hsl(var(--muted-foreground) / 0.3);
       }
     }
     ```
     Then, use @apply bg-muted-foreground-30 rounded-full; instead.

2. Alternatively, select a similar existing Tailwind color (e.g., bg-gray-500/30) as a temporary fix:
   ```css
   ::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
     @apply bg-gray-500/30 rounded-full;
   }
   ```

Update all @apply bg-muted-foreground/30 usages in your CSS to one of these approaches and the build will succeed. For more information, refer to your globals.css at ref 713de158b6e15536f153dfcac3829259f42f26f1.
