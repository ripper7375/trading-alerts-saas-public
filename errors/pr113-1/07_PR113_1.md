The job failed because the test summary step detected a failure in one or more dependent jobs and then ran this command:

```bash
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

(see: test-summary job in the workflow).

To determine the exact cause, check the results of the jobs "unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", and "build-check". The summary step's conditional will fail if any of these jobs fail.

Solution: Review the logs of the individual jobs (especially test outputs for "unit-and-component-tests" and "integration-tests", and the bundle size/build step for "build-check"). Address the root issue in the failing job. For instance:

- Fix any failing tests.
- Resolve TypeScript or ESLint errors.
- If the build size exceeds the limit (360MB), optimize dependencies or code splitting.

You can view and edit the workflow file here: [.github/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/713de158b6e15536f153dfcac3829259f42f26f1/.github/workflows/tests.yml). Once the underlying test or build issue is addressed, the summary job will pass.
