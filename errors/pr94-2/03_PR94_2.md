The job failed due to ESLint errors: several variables are defined but never used, and some variables should be declared with const instead of let or var. Here are focused solutions:

1. Remove unused variables or prefix their names with \_ if they're intentionally unused:

- In app/(dashboard)/alerts/new/create-alert-client.tsx at line 56: Remove 'ConditionType' if unused.
- In app/(dashboard)/settings/account/page.tsx at lines 12 and 13: Remove or rename 'Laptop' and 'Smartphone' to '\_Laptop' and '\_Smartphone' if intentionally unused.
- In app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts at lines 19, 95, and 102: Remove or prefix with \_ on 'z', 'isValidSymbol', 'isValidTimeframe' if unused.
- In components/ui/pagination.tsx at line 225: Do the same for 'showEndButtons'.

2. Change declaration to const for variables never reassigned:

- In app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts at lines 261 and 275: Change let upperSymbol = ... to const upperSymbol = ... and let upperTimeframe = ... to const upperTimeframe = ...

Example fix:

```ts
// Instead of unused variable
const ConditionType = ...     // Remove if not used or rename to _ConditionType

// For variables that are never reassigned
const upperSymbol = ...
const upperTimeframe = ...
```

Apply these changes, commit, and rerun the workflow—the job will pass if all unused variables are handled and declarations use const when needed.
