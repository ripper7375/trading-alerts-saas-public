The job failed because the Test Summary step found that one or more dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) did not succeed. The workflow summary script explicitly exits with an error if any of these jobs failed.

Solution:

1. Check the results of the unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check jobs to identify which job(s) failed.
2. Once you've identified the failing job(s), review their logs to pinpoint the error (it may be a test failure, dependency issue, build error, or size check).
3. Fix the underlying issue in your codebase or configuration. For example:
   - If tests are failing, update or fix the failing test or related source code.
   - If dependencies fail to install, review your pnpm or lockfile setup.
   - If the production build exceeds the size limit, reduce bundle size or optimize assets.

After addressing the specific failing job, the Test Summary step should succeed automatically. For more details, see the job definition in the tests.yml workflow (ref: b9087f06ef5cb5e8136dc9335657399736f5aa54).
