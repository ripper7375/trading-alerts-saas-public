The build is failing because of the following error in app/api/user/login-history/route.ts line 63:

Property 'loginHistory' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.

This means your Prisma schema does not have a loginHistory model, or you forgot to generate the Prisma client after updating your schema.

Solution:

1. Make sure you have a loginHistory model in your Prisma schema (typically in prisma/schema.prisma), for example:

```prisma
model LoginHistory {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId       String
  status       String
  provider     String
  deviceType   String?
  browser      String?
  browserVersion String?
  os           String?
  osVersion    String?
  ipAddress    String?
  country      String?
  city         String?
  region       String?
  isNewDevice  Boolean
  createdAt    DateTime @default(now())

  // User relation example if you need it
  // user         User @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
}
```

2. Run npx prisma generate to update your Prisma client.
3. If the model exists and you're sure your code should work, check for typos (loginHistory vs LoginHistory).
4. If the model name in your schema is LoginHistory (PascalCase), the corresponding property in Prisma Client should be prisma.loginHistory (camelCase). If your model is named something else, use the corresponding property.

Update your schema and re-generate the Prisma client as above, and the build should pass. For reference, here’s the code location with the error: [route.ts#L63](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/28db2f5092794f0d641be6625e929fc952a8f0c0/app/api/user/login-history/route.ts#L63).
