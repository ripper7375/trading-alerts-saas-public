The failing job (59207835000) is caused by the "Test Summary" step in your workflow. The conclusion step checks the results of all previous test jobs, and if any have failed or been skipped, it runs echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and exits with code 1.

From the logs:

- Both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were skipped.

This happens because their trigger conditions or dependencies might not have been satisfied. Review the needs and if conditions in your .github/workflows/tests.yml to ensure all prerequisite jobs either run successfully or are marked as optional/skipped intentionally.

To prevent the failure due to skipped jobs, you can update the fail-if-any-test-failed step to only fail if the job result is specifically "failure", not "skipped". Change this part:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

to guard against skipped jobs:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
# Optionally, add conditions to ignore 'skipped'
```

Or, further refine result tests using explicit check for 'skipped' if needed.

After making this change, rerun your workflow. This ensures the summary only fails when an actual test fails, not when jobs are intentionally skipped.
