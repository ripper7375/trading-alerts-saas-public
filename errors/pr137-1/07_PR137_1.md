The failing job (ID 59206986845) failed because at least one of the required test jobs ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", or "build-check") did not complete successfully, triggering this summary step:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

However, your job log shows both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were marked as skipped, which usually indicates their dependencies ("unit-and-component-tests" job) did not succeed. The root cause is likely a failure in the "unit-and-component-tests" job.

To resolve:

1. Check the log output of the "unit-and-component-tests" job for specific errors (look for failing steps like install, type-check, lint, or tests).
2. Address the error in code or configuration (e.g., fix failing tests, type errors, or dependency issues).
3. Re-run the workflow after correcting the failure in "unit-and-component-tests".

If you need help with the specific failure, share the log or error message from the "unit-and-component-tests" job for targeted advice.
