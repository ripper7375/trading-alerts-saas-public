The job failed due to TypeScript ESLint errors:

1. In app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx (line 11): The Loader2 import is defined but never used.

   **Solution:** Remove the unused import:

   ```diff
   -   Loader2,
   ```

   Or, if you plan to use Loader2 later, prefix it with an underscore:

   ```diff
   -   Loader2,
   +   _Loader2,
   ```

   (But best practice is to remove unused imports.)

2. In lib/security/device-detection.ts (line 190): The ipAddress parameter is defined but never used.

   **Solution:** Either remove the ipAddress parameter from the function definition and all function calls, or, if it's needed for interface reasons, prefix it with an underscore:

   ```diff
   -   ipAddress: string
   +   _ipAddress: string
   ```

Apply these fixes to resolve the linting errors and allow the job to complete successfully.
