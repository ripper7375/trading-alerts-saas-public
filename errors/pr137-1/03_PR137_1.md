Your build is failing due to two ESLint errors that violate @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars:

1. In app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx:  
   'Loader2' is imported from 'lucide-react' but never used.  
   **Solution:** Remove Loader2 from the import list.

   Change:

   ```tsx
   import {
     Shield,
     History,
     Bell,
     Loader2,
     RefreshCw,
     Monitor,
     Smartphone,
     Tablet,
     Laptop,
     MapPin,
     Check,
     X,
     AlertTriangle,
   } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

   To:

   ```tsx
   import {
     Shield,
     History,
     Bell,
     RefreshCw,
     Monitor,
     Smartphone,
     Tablet,
     Laptop,
     MapPin,
     Check,
     X,
     AlertTriangle,
   } from 'lucide-react';
   ```

2. In lib/security/device-detection.ts:  
   The function argument 'ipAddress' at line 190 is defined but never used in generateDeviceFingerprint.  
   **Solution:** If you do not use ipAddress, prefix it with an underscore:

   Change:

   ```typescript
   export function generateDeviceFingerprint(
     userAgent: string,
     ipAddress: string
   ): string {
   ```

   To:

   ```typescript
   export function generateDeviceFingerprint(
     userAgent: string,
     _ipAddress: string
   ): string {
   ```

Fix these two issues to resolve the failing job. If you want to ignore these errors, you can disable the rule for those lines as described in the Next.js docs, but the best solution is to remove or properly prefix the unused variables.
