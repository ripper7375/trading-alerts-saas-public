The job failed because your pnpm-lock.yaml specifies swr as ^2.2.4, but your package.json uses ^2.3.8. This mismatch causes pnpm install --frozen-lockfile to exit with error. To fix this:

1. Update your pnpm-lock.yaml to match package.json:
   - Run pnpm install to regenerate the lockfile, or
   - Manually adjust pnpm-lock.yaml so that for the swr entry under dependencies, the specifier is ^2.3.8.

Example (in pnpm-lock.yaml under the main importer/dependencies):

```yaml
swr:
  specifier: ^2.3.8
  version: 2.3.8(react@19.2.3)
```

2. Commit the resulting pnpm-lock.yaml.

Summary: Always run pnpm install after changing package.json dependencies so the lockfile stays in sync. This will resolve the CI failure.
