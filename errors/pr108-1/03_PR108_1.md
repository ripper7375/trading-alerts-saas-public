The failing job indicates a dependency mismatch between package.json and package-lock.json for the swr package:

- package.json: "swr": "^2.3.8"
- package-lock.json: "swr": "^2.2.4"

**Solution:**  
You need to update your lockfile so that its specifier matches what’s in your package.json.

**Steps:**

1. Run the following command in your project root:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will update your package-lock.json.

2. Commit the updated package-lock.json to your branch.

**Optional (if you want to target exactly your specified version):**

```bash
npm install swr@^2.3.8
```

This will ensure that both package.json and package-lock.json use "^2.3.8" for swr, resolving the job's failure.
