The failing job report shows a key error:

- Dependency mismatch: In package.json, swr is specified as ^2.3.8, but in your lockfile (likely package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml), it's pinned to ^2.2.4.

Solution:

1. Update your lockfile to match the manifest (package.json).
   - If you use npm, run:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - If you use yarn, run:
     ```
     yarn install
     ```
   - If you use pnpm, run:
     ```
     pnpm install
     ```
     This will synchronize your lockfile to match package.json.

2. Stage and commit the updated lockfile:
   ```
   git add package-lock.json # or yarn.lock, or pnpm-lock.yaml
   git commit -m "fix: update lockfile to match package.json dependencies"
   ```

Additional error (not a blocker, but should be addressed):

- PostgreSQL error: "role 'root' does not exist."
  - Ensure your test DB configuration is using a valid PostgreSQL user/role.

Summary:

- Run your package manager's install command locally and commit the lockfile changes to resolve the dependency mismatch and unblock your workflow.
