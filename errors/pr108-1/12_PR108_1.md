The job failed because the "Test Summary" step is set up to exit with code 1 if any of the previous jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed. From the logs, both Integration Tests and Build Check are marked as "skipped." This commonly means their dependencies were not met—most likely because the prerequisite jobs did not run or were skipped, which results in the summary step treating them as failures.

How to fix:

- Ensure that all dependent jobs ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", "build-check") run and complete. Skipped jobs will cause the "test-summary" to mark the workflow as failed.
- If you intend to skip certain jobs, modify the "test-summary" logic to treat "skipped" as a non-failure state.

For example, replace this in your [.github/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/7fb12cc8341ac4ea9857d4c994e07820027803af/.github/workflows/tests.yml):

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

With:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  # optionally, add 'cancelled' or 'skipped' checks here if you want stricter handling
```

Or explicitly handle "skipped" or "cancelled" as desired.

To summarize: rerun the workflow ensuring all dependent jobs execute; or adjust the conditional in the "Fail if any test failed" step to handle skipped jobs according to your intent.
