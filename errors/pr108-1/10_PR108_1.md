The failing job log identifies a dependency version mismatch:

- The lockfile (likely package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml) specifies swr as ^2.2.4.
- package.json specifies swr as ^2.3.8.

Solution: Sync package.json and your lockfile.

Recommended Fix:

1. Update swr in package.json and regenerate your lockfile:

If you want to use swr@^2.3.8:

```bash
npm install swr@^2.3.8
# or, if using yarn:
# yarn add swr@^2.3.8
# or with pnpm:
# pnpm add swr@^2.3.8
```

2. Commit both updated package.json and the new lockfile.

3. Push your changes and re-run the workflow.

This will ensure version consistency and fix the job failure.
