The job failed because the swr package version specifier in your lockfile (probably package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml) does not match the one in your package.json:

- Lockfile specifies: ^2.2.4
- Manifest (package.json) specifies: ^2.3.8

Solution:
Sync the package version in your lockfile with package.json. You can do this by running:

If you use npm:

```sh
npm install
```

If you use pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

If you use yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

This will update your lockfile so the swr version matches ^2.3.8 as specified in package.json. After updating, commit the updated lockfile and push your changes. This should resolve the workflow failure.
