The job failed because the version specifier for the swr dependency in your pnpm-lock.yaml does not match what is specified in your package.json. Your package.json lists swr as "^2.3.8", but pnpm-lock.yaml has it under "^2.2.4".

**Solution:**  
Run the following command from your project root to update your lockfile and resolve the mismatch:

```sh
pnpm install
```

This will sync your lockfile with your manifest (package.json) and should fix the error.

If you want to do it manually:

1. Open your pnpm-lock.yaml and update the swr specifier under `dependencies:` for the root importer (.) to match the manifest:

   ```yaml
   swr:
     specifier: ^2.3.8
     version: 2.3.8(react@19.2.3)
   ```

   (Make sure the version and specifier match what is in your package.json and that the installed version exists.)

2. Save the file, and re-run your CI or `pnpm install` locally to regenerate the lockfile correctly.

This will eliminate the lockfile and manifest version mismatch for swr and prevent the CI failure.
