The job failed because the dependency specifiers for swr in your lockfile and package.json don't match:

- package.json: "swr": "^2.3.8"
- pnpm-lock.yaml: swr specifier is "^2.2.4", but version resolved is 2.3.8

To resolve this:

1. Ensure that your package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml are in sync for swr:

In your project root, run:

```sh
pnpm install swr@^2.3.8
```

or, if everything is already at the correct version in package.json, force regeneration of the lockfile:

```sh
pnpm install --refresh-lockfile
```

2. Commit both the updated pnpm-lock.yaml and your package.json if anything changes. This will resolve the version mismatch and allow the CI job to proceed.
