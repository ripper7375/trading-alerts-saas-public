The failure occurred in the test-summary job, which is designed to summarize the results of previous jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) and fails if any of them did not succeed. According to the job logs, both Integration Tests and Build Check were skipped, leading to this summary step executing:

```bash
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

This causes the entire workflow to fail.

To resolve this:

- Ensure the dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) are not skipped and are actually being executed.
- Verify trigger conditions in your workflow file: integration-tests should only run if unit-and-component-tests succeed, and build-check waits for both previous jobs. If workflow run conditions (such as manual skip, conditional requirements, or matrix exclusions) are causing the jobs to be skipped, revisit branch filters and job dependencies.
- If intentional skipping is desired in some scenarios, you may adjust the fail logic in the summary step not to exit with failure when jobs are skipped instead of failed. For example, modify the conditional in the test-summary to only fail if jobs were actually run and failed, rather than skipped:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

could be expanded to explicitly check for 'failure' only (not 'skipped').

Check your workflow definition for why the prerequisite jobs are skipped and adjust triggers or fail-logic accordingly. You can view the relevant workflow file here (.github/workflows/tests.yml, ref 4264ca561459de81cf661eb083bb5e717ec2ba77).
