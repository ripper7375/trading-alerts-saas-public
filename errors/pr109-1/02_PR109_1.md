The failing job reports:

> specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
>
> - 1 dependencies are mismatched:
>   - swr (lockfile: ^2.2.4, manifest: ^2.3.8)

**Problem:**  
In `package.json`, the dependency `swr` is set as `^2.3.8` (see [package.json#L98](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/4264ca561459de81cf661eb083bb5e717ec2ba77/package.json)), but in `pnpm-lock.yaml`, its specifier is `^2.2.4`.

**Solution:**  
To resolve this, synchronize the versions between `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

1. Delete `pnpm-lock.yaml`:
   ```sh
   rm pnpm-lock.yaml
   ```
2. Reinstall dependencies and generate a fresh lockfile:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
3. Commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

This ensures that the lockfile matches the specifiers in your `package.json`.
