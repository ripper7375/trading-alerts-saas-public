The failing job encountered two main issues:

1. Dependency Mismatch:

- Error: "specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json"
- Details: The lockfile has swr@^2.2.4, but package.json requires swr@^2.3.8.

Solution:

- Run one of the following in your project root to update the lockfile:
  - For npm:
    ```
    npm install
    ```
    or, if you want to force refresh:
    ```
    npm install swr@^2.3.8
    ```
  - For yarn:
    ```
    yarn install
    ```
    or, to update swr specifically:
    ```
    yarn add swr@^2.3.8
    ```
- Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).

2. Codecov Coverage Report Failure:

- Error: "No coverage reports found. Please make sure you're generating reports successfully."
- Details: coverage/lcov.info is missing or not generated.

Solution:

- Ensure your test script generates a coverage report at coverage/lcov.info. For example, if you use Jest, your package.json should include:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "jest --coverage"
  }
  ```
- Or, check you have coverage setup in your test runner configuration.
- Run the tests locally to make sure the coverage report is generated.
- Commit any changes required to generate the coverage file.

Summary of steps:

1. Sync lockfile and package.json for swr dependency (update, then commit the lockfile).
2. Ensure coverage generation produces coverage/lcov.info during CI (review your test/config setup).

Apply these solutions and re-run your workflow to resolve the failures. If you need to see the specific sections of package.json, lockfile, or CI workflow, let me know!
