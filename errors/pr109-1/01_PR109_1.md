The job failed because there's a mismatch between the dependency version of swr in your package.json and your pnpm-lock.yaml. In package.json, swr is specified as ^2.3.8, but the lockfile has ^2.2.4 as its specifier, both resolving to version 2.3.8.

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile to reflect the correct version specifier. Run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Afterwards, commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml file to resolve the specifier mismatch. This will fix the lockfile error and allow your CI job to proceed.
