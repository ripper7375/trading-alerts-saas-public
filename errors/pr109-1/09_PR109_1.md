The failing job is due to a dependency version mismatch:

- In your package.json, swr is set to "^2.3.8"
- In your package-lock.json, swr is set to "^2.2.4"

To resolve this:

1. Run the following command to update the lockfile:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   This will align your package-lock.json with package.json and use the correct swr version.

2. Commit the updated package-lock.json file.

This will fix the workflow failure caused by the mismatch. If you continue using npm, it’s important after any package.json change to always update and commit package-lock.json as well.
