The failure is due to a dependency version mismatch between your package.json and pnpm-lock.yaml for the swr package:

- package.json: "swr": "^2.3.8"
- pnpm-lock.yaml: specifier for swr is "^2.2.4"

To resolve:

1. Run the following command to update the lockfile to match your package.json:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   or, if you are using npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml to your repository.

If you specifically want to keep version ^2.3.8 of swr, ensure that package.json and the lockfile match. After updating, your CI job should pass.
