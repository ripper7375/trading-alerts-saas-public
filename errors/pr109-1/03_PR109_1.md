The job failed because the version specifier for the package swr in package.json ("^2.3.8") does not match the specifier in pnpm-lock.yaml ("^2.2.4"). This causes a dependency mismatch error.

**Solution:**  
To resolve this, update the pnpm-lock.yaml file so its swr version specifier matches that in package.json.

**How to fix:**

1. Run the following command to update the lockfile based on your current package.json:
   ```sh
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Commit the updated pnpm-lock.yaml file.

This will re-sync the lockfile with your declared dependencies and fix the workflow error.

After making this fix, the job should succeed.
