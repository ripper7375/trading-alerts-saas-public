The failing job is due to a mismatch between the dependencies listed in package.json and those resolved in package-lock.json. The error message is:

> specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
>
> - 5 dependencies were added: @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10, jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3, @types/qrcode@^1.5.6, otplib@^12.0.1, qrcode@^1.5.4

These dependencies exist in your package.json (see lines 101, 112-114, 133, 145), but the lockfile does not reflect them correctly. This most often happens when package.json is updated but pnpm install is not run to update the lockfile, or the lockfile is not committed.

**Solution:**

1. Run pnpm install locally to synchronize the lockfile (package-lock.json) with the latest package.json.
2. Commit the updated package-lock.json and push the changes.

**Sample commands:**

```sh
pnpm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: update lockfile to match package.json"
git push
```

This will resolve the mismatch and allow the CI job to pass. For reference:
