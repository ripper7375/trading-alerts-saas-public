The failing job occurred because the specifiers in your lockfile don't match the dependencies listed in package.json:

- 5 dependencies were added: @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10, jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3, @types/qrcode@^1.5.6, otplib@^12.0.1, qrcode@^1.5.4

This error typically means you updated package.json directly or changed dependencies, but haven't regenerated package-lock.json (or, since you are using pnpm, pnpm-lock.yaml).

**Solution:**

1. Run the following in your project root to update your lockfile:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   or, if you use npm:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

   This will update your lockfile to be in sync with package.json.

2. Commit the updated lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml or package-lock.json).

**Code suggestion:**

```sh
# For pnpm (recommended, based on your workflow setup)
pnpm install

# For npm (if you use npm)
npm install
```

After committing the regenerated lockfile, push your changes and re-run the workflow. This will resolve the dependency specifier mismatch and allow the CI job to complete.
