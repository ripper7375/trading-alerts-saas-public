The job failed because the dependency audit, type check, and linting steps all failed. According to the workflow definition (.github/workflows/security-checks.yml at ref de8d0af213bc146ff2c493172155fb44bdae0d6c), these steps run:

- Dependency audit: pnpm audit --audit-level=high
- Type check: pnpm run type-check
- Linting: pnpm run lint

Recommended solutions:

1. Run pnpm install locally to ensure dependencies are consistent. Then run pnpm audit --audit-level=high and address any vulnerabilities reported with upgrades or resolutions.
2. Run pnpm run type-check and fix all reported TypeScript errors.
3. Run pnpm run lint and resolve any linting errors.

Once all these command-line checks pass locally, commit your fixes. This will resolve the failing job for dependency audit, type checking, and linting. For more detail, see the workflow source: .github/workflows/security-checks.yml (ref de8d0af213bc146ff2c493172155fb44bdae0d6c).
