The job failed because the dependency specifiers in package.json and package-lock.json are not in sync. Specifically, 5 dependencies were recently added or updated in package.json:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

However, the lockfile (package-lock.json) does not reflect these changes. This is likely due to updating package.json without running pnpm install (or the equivalent) to update the lockfile.

**Solution:**

1. Run the following command in your project root to update package-lock.json:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will synchronize package-lock.json with the entries in package.json.

2. Commit and push both the updated package.json and package-lock.json files.

This will resolve the lockfile mismatch and allow your CI job to proceed. If you use npm instead of pnpm, use:

```
npm install
```

Make sure to commit both files after resolving the lockfile.

Reference the relevant files:

- package.json ([view](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/de8d0af213bc146ff2c493172155fb44bdae0d6c/package.json))
- package-lock.json ([view](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/de8d0af213bc146ff2c493172155fb44bdae0d6c/package-lock.json))

No changes are needed to the workflow definition itself.
