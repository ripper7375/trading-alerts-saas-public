The failure is caused by a mismatch between the dependencies listed in your lockfile and those in package.json. Specifically, five dependencies were added:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

To fix this, run the following command in your project directory to sync your lockfile with package.json:

If you use npm:

```sh
npm install
```

If you use yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

Then commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to your repository.

This will resolve the misalignment, and the failing job should succeed on the next run.
