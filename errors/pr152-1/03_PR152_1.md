The job failed because the dependencies listed in your package.json do not match your lockfile. Specifically, the following dependencies appear to have been added or updated, but this has not been reflected in the lockfile:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

**How to fix:**

1. On your branch, run one of the following commands in your project root, depending on your package manager:

- For npm:
  ```bash
  npm install
  ```
- For yarn:
  ```bash
  yarn install
  ```
- For pnpm:
  ```bash
  pnpm install
  ```

2. This will update your lockfile (e.g., package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to match the dependencies in package.json.

3. Commit the updated lockfile and push the change to your branch.

**Summary:**  
Update your lockfile by running the install command for your package manager and commit the changes. This will resolve the dependency mismatch and fix the job failure.
