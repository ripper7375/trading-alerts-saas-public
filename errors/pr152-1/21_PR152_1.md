The failure is due to a mismatch between dependency specifiers in your lockfile and your package.json. Specifically, these dependencies were added in package.json but the lockfile was not updated:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

To resolve this, run the following command in your project root:

npm install

or, if you use yarn:

yarn install

This will update your lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to match package.json. After you commit and push the updated lockfile, the job should pass.
