The job failed because dependencies listed in package.json and those locked in package-lock.json are out of sync. Specifically, the following dependencies were either added or changed in package.json but are not reflected in the lockfile:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

**Solution:**
You need to update your package-lock.json to match your current package.json. Run the following command in your repository root:

```sh
pnpm install --lockfile-only
```

or, if using npm:

```sh
npm install --package-lock-only
```

This will regenerate package-lock.json with the correct set of dependencies matching package.json.

After updating the lockfile, commit the changes to both package.json and package-lock.json. This will resolve the lockfile mismatch and allow the workflow to proceed.
