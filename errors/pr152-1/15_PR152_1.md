The failing job (59233069192) reports this error:

specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:

- 5 dependencies were added: @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10, jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3, @types/qrcode@^1.5.6, otplib@^12.0.1, qrcode@^1.5.4

This means your package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) is out of sync with package.json. Typically, this occurs after dependencies are added/updated in package.json without running the appropriate lockfile update.

**Solution:**

1. On your branch, run the install command to update the lockfile:
   - For npm:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```
   - For yarn:
     ```sh
     yarn install
     ```
2. This will update your lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to match the `package.json` dependency specifiers.
3. Commit the updated lockfile and push to your PR branch.

**Example Commit:**

```
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: update lockfile to match package.json dependencies"
git push
```

This will resolve the mismatch and allow the job to pass.
