The failure is caused by a mismatch between dependency specifiers in your package.json and the lockfile. Specifically, the following dependencies were added or changed in package.json, but the lockfile was not updated accordingly:

- @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10
- jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3
- @types/qrcode@^1.5.6
- otplib@^12.0.1
- qrcode@^1.5.4

Solution:

1. Run your package manager's install or update command to refresh the lockfile. For most setups, this looks like:
   - If using npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - If using yarn:
     ```
     yarn install
     ```
2. Stage and commit the updated lockfile (e.g., package-lock.json or yarn.lock).

Example git commands:

```sh
git add package-lock.json    # or yarn.lock
git commit -m "Fix: update lockfile to match package.json dependencies"
```

Once you push this fix, re-run your CI job. This will resolve the dependency specifier mismatch and your workflow should pass.
