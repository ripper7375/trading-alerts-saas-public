The failing job error is:

specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:

- 5 dependencies were added: @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10, jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3, @types/qrcode@^1.5.6, otplib@^12.0.1, qrcode@^1.5.4

Solution:

Synchronize your lockfile with your updated package.json. Usually, this is because dependencies were added or changed in package.json but yarn.lock or package-lock.json was not updated.

To fix:

1. Run the following command locally:
   - If you use npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - If you use yarn:
     ```
     yarn install
     ```
2. This will update your lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).
3. Commit the updated lockfile to your branch and push.

This will resolve the mismatch and allow your workflow to pass.

If you need further help, please share which package manager is used (npm or yarn), or share your workflow’s relevant steps so I can provide more exact commands.
