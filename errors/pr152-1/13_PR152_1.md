The failing job error is:

> "specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json: 5 dependencies were added: @types/jsonwebtoken@^9.0.10, jsonwebtoken@^9.0.3, @types/qrcode@^1.5.6, otplib@^12.0.1, qrcode@^1.5.4"

This means dependencies listed in package.json differ from those in package-lock.json, likely due to adding new packages without re-locking.

**Solution:**

1. Re-run the package manager to regenerate the lockfile so it matches package.json.
   - With pnpm (as used in your workflow):
     ```
     pnpm install
     ```
     Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` (if using PNPM).
   - With npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
     Then commit the updated `package-lock.json`.
2. Push the changes to your PR/branch.

This will resolve dependency drift and allow the workflow to continue.
