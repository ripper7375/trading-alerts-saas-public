The failing job 59233082899 fails at the "Test Summary" stage, which checks if any of the required jobs ("Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Production Build Check") failed. According to the logs:

- Both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" steps were skipped.
- The failure message "❌ One or more test jobs failed" suggests that at least one of the required jobs did not run or did not pass.

Based on your workflow, this can happen if a required job is skipped due to unmet conditions, missing dependencies, or earlier failures. This commonly occurs if the previous jobs aren't triggered (e.g., because of branch filters) or if artifacts from earlier steps are missing or not produced.

**Solution:**

1. Check that all required jobs—`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, and `build-check`—run for your pull request. In your workflow, integration and build steps depend on unit test completion. If the unit tests are skipped or not triggered, downstream jobs will also skip or fail.
2. Verify your branch filters (lines 5 and 7). For PRs targeting branches other than `main` or `develop`, none of these jobs will run and the summary job will report a failure.

**Code suggestion:** If you need all jobs to run for every PR or specific branches, update your workflow `on.pull_request` filter:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - '**'
```

Or more selectively, include all branches needed.

**Summary:** This failure can be fixed by ensuring your PR triggers all the jobs referenced in the test summary step. Update your workflow file accordingly to avoid skipped jobs and subsequent summary failures.
