The job failed due to a dependency mismatch between your lockfile and package.json:

- swr (lockfile: ^2.2.4, manifest: ^2.3.8)

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile to match the swr version specified in package.json, or update package.json to match the lockfile, so both reference the same version.

**Recommended steps:**

1. Update your lockfile:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   This will update your lockfile based on the version in package.json.

2. If you're using yarn:

   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```

3. Commit the updated lockfile to the repository.

Alternatively, if you want the lockfile to stay the same, update `package.json` to match:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "swr": "^2.2.4"
}
```

Then run install and commit.

Codecov errors (token missing, coverage file missing) are secondary. Fix the lockfile first, then verify that the coverage report is generated and present at `coverage/lcov.info`, and add a Codecov token if needed.

Let me know if you need code suggestions for the Codecov issue after fixing the dependency mismatch.
