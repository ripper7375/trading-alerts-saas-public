There are two main issues causing the job to fail:

### 1. Dependency Mismatch

- The lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) specifies `swr` as `^2.2.4`, but your `package.json` requires `^2.3.8`.
- Solution: Update the lockfile to match your `package.json`. Most commonly, run:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
  or
  ```sh
  yarn install
  ```
  This will update the lockfile and fix the mismatch. After that, commit and push the updated lockfile.

### 2. PostgreSQL Role Error

- The logs show: `FATAL:  role "root" does not exist`
- Solution: Your database setup is trying to connect with the user `root`, but that role does not exist in the PostgreSQL instance.
  - For test/dev environments, update your database credentials to use a valid PostgreSQL role, often `postgres` by default.
  - In your environment configuration (like `.env` or your workflow file), change:
    ```
    DB_USER=postgres
    ```
    (or another username you have set up). Make sure the workflow creates the role if necessary, e.g.:
    ```yaml
    - name: Create DB role
      run: |
        psql -U postgres -c "CREATE ROLE root WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'yourpassword';"
    ```
    Or simply use `postgres` as `DB_USER`.

**Summary of changes:**

- Run `npm install` to fix lockfile mismatch.
- Change database connection settings from `root` to a valid PostgreSQL user (e.g. `postgres`).

If you need exact file locations or further code edits, let me know which config files you want to update.
