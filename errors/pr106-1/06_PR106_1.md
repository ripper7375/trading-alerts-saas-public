The job failed because the dependency specifiers for swr differ between package.json and the lockfile. Specifically:

- lockfile: ^2.2.4
- package.json: ^2.3.8

**Solution:**
To fix this, synchronize the swr version in both package.json and the lockfile:

1. Update your lockfile:
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to regenerate the lockfile based on the package.json specifier.

2. Commit the updated lockfile:
   - Add and commit the changes to ensure both files are consistent.

**Example commands:**

```sh
npm install
git add package-lock.json  # or yarn.lock if you use yarn
git commit -m "Sync swr dependency version in lockfile"
```

If you intend to use the older version (`^2.2.4`), change package.json to match. Otherwise, always keep package.json as the source of truth and let the lockfile regenerate.

**Summary:**  
Regenerate your lockfile by running the install command, then commit the lockfile changes. This will resolve the mismatch causing the CI failure.
