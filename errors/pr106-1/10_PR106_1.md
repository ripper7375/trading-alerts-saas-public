The failure was caused by a mismatch between the version of the swr package specified in your package.json (^2.3.8) and the version in your lockfile (^2.2.4). To resolve this:

1. Open your package.json and confirm swr is set to "^2.3.8".
2. Run the following command to update your lockfile and install the correct version:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   or for Yarn:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).

If you want to ensure consistency going forward, periodically run:

```bash
npm install --package-lock-only
```

or for Yarn:

```bash
yarn install --pure-lockfile
```

This will synchronize your dependencies and prevent similar CI failures.
