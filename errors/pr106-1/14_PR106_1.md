The job failed for these reasons:

1. Dependency version mismatch:
   - swr dependency is mismatched between package.json and the lockfile:
     - package.json: ^2.3.8
     - lockfile: ^2.2.4

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile (usually package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to match the version in package.json for swr.  
Run one of the following commands based on your package manager:

- If using npm:
  ```
  npm install
  ```
- If using yarn:
  ```
  yarn install
  ```

This will regenerate the lockfile to sync with package.json.

2. Missing coverage file for Codecov:
   - Error: Coverage file ./coverage/lcov.info not found.

**Solution:**  
Verify your test suite is generating a coverage report in the expected location.

- If using Jest, ensure your `jest.config.js` includes:
  ```js
  coverageDirectory: "coverage",
  coverageReporters: ["lcov", "text"],
  ```
- After running tests, ensure `coverage/lcov.info` exists.
- If it’s missing, run your test command with coverage enabled:
  ```
  npm test -- --coverage
  ```

**Steps to fix:**

1. Resolve the dependency mismatch by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
2. Ensure coverage is generated by updating your test configuration and test command.

If you need help with your workflow file or test config, let me know the details so I can suggest code updates.
