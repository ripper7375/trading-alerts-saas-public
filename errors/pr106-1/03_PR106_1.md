The job failed due to a dependency version mismatch between your lockfile and package.json:

- swr is listed as ^2.2.4 in the lockfile, but as ^2.3.8 in package.json.

To fix this, ensure both files specify the same swr version. Here are two ways to resolve it:

**Recommended Solution:**

1. Update your lockfile to match package.json.  
   Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will update your lockfile to use swr@^2.3.8.

2. Commit the updated lockfile:
   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json # or yarn.lock if you use yarn
   git commit -m "Update lockfile to match swr version in package.json"
   ```

**Alternative Solution:**  
If you want to keep the older version (^2.2.4), change package.json to match:

1. Edit package.json:
   ```json
   "swr": "^2.2.4"
   ```
2. Run `npm install` and commit the change.

**Summary:**  
Make sure both package.json and the lockfile specify the same swr version, and commit the updated files. This will resolve the mismatch and allow the job to succeed.
