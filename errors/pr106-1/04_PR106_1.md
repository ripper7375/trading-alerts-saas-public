The job failed because the swr dependency version in your lockfile (^2.2.4) does not match the version specified in package.json (^2.3.8).

To fix this:

1. Update your lockfile to match package.json. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will synchronize the lockfile with package.json.

2. Commit the updated lockfile:

   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json  # or yarn.lock/pnpm-lock.yaml, depending on your package manager
   git commit -m "Update lockfile to match swr version in package.json"
   ```

3. Push the changes to your branch and re-run the workflow.

If you need to update the package.json instead, match it to the lockfile version (^2.2.4), then run npm install and commit both files.
