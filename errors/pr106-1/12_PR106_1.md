The failing job 59025394823 is the "Test Summary" job, which fails if any of the required test jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) fail. However, according to the logs, both the "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" steps were skipped. This indicates that their dependent jobs ("unit-and-component-tests" or earlier steps) failed or were skipped, preventing these jobs from running.

To resolve this, you should ensure that "unit-and-component-tests" completes successfully. Here are targeted solutions:

1. Check .github/workflows/tests.yml for missing or misconfigured steps in "unit-and-component-tests". Make sure all necessary setup (Node, pnpm, Prisma client) and test scripts are correct.
2. Run pnpm install locally to confirm dependency issues aren't causing pnpm install --frozen-lockfile to fail.
3. Make sure test scripts (pnpm run type-check, pnpm run lint, pnpm run test:ci) succeed locally. Fix any TypeScript, linting, or test errors that are causing failures.
4. If you use GitHub Actions matrices, ensure all matrix combinations (Node version, etc.) work.

Code suggestions:

- Fix failing unit or component tests and commit the fixes.
- Update your type-check or lint configuration if false positives are causing failures.
- In your tests.yml, you can add more detailed error output for each failing step:

```yaml
# Example to make test failures more visible
- name: Run unit and component tests
  run: pnpm run test:ci || { cat <your-test-output-file>; exit 1; }
```

Investigate the results of the "unit-and-component-tests" job for the specific error, resolve it, and then re-run your workflow.
