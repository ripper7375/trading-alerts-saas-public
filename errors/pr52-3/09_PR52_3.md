The failing job 58912526608 is caused by the test-summary job in your workflow. The job checks if all test jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) succeeded. If any have failed or been skipped, it marks the workflow as failed using this block in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: bc174a29b3de6fc1a87b1b6b119e8a43673511be):

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result != 'success'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

However, your logs indicate that both integration tests and build check jobs were "skipped," so this summary step triggers a failure.

Solution:

- Ensure that all dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) actually run and do not get skipped. They may be conditionally skipped due to filters in the workflow dispatch, branch patterns, or if jobs earlier in the matrix fail/are skipped.
- If you want the summary job to tolerate skipped test jobs, modify the condition from 'success' to allow 'skipped' as well. For example:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

This only fails the summary if a job actually fails, not if it's skipped.

- Double check your branch and workflow filters (lines 4–7 in the workflow file) to ensure jobs run as expected for your pull request.

Adjust the if condition in the test-summary job, or review your workflow/job triggering criteria to resolve the failure.
