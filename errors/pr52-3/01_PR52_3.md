The failure is caused by a TypeScript type incompatibility in components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx at line 184. The error message is:

Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }[]' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>[]'.  
Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>'.  
Types of property 'time' are incompatible.

This occurs because the time property may be undefined, but LineData<Time> expects time: Time (not undefined). To resolve this, filter out points where time is undefined before mapping them or perform stronger type narrowing after the mapping step.

Replace lines 184-189 with the following code, which filters before mapping. This approach matches the pattern in other parts of the file and satisfies the type definition:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints
  .filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
  .map((p) => ({
    time: timeData[p.index],
    value: p.price,
  }));
```

Make this change. This will fix the type error and allow the job to complete successfully.
