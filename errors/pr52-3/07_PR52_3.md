The failing job is due to the use of type { time: Time | undefined; value: number; }[] where a LineData<Time>[] is expected. TypeScript reports that type 'Time | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Time', specifically at lines 184, 215, and 246 in components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx.

Solution:
You need to ensure the time property is always a valid Time, never undefined, before passing it to the LineData. In your mapping functions for lineData, peakData, and bottomData, update .map so that only entries with valid time are included, rather than filtering after mapping.

Update your mapping like this:

Instead of:

```tsx
.map((p) => ({
  time: timeData[p.index],
  value: p.price,
}));
```

Use:

```tsx
.flatMap((p) =>
  timeData[p.index] !== undefined
    ? [{ time: timeData[p.index], value: p.price }]
    : []
);
```

Or filter before mapping:

```tsx
.filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
.map((p) => ({
  time: timeData[p.index] as Time,
  value: p.price,
}));
```

Apply this change at lines 184, 215, and 246:

For example, at line 184:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints
  .filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
  .map((p) => ({
    time: timeData[p.index] as Time,
    value: p.price,
  }));
```

Do similarly for the blocks at 215 (peak markers) and 246 (bottom markers). This guarantees that time is never undefined and will fix the type errors. See the file here for reference: components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx@bc174a29b3de6fc1a87b1b6b119e8a43673511be.
