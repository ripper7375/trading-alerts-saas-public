The job failed due to a TypeScript type error in components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx at line 184. The error message is:

Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }[]' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>[]'.
Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>'.
Types of property 'time' are incompatible.

This is because the mapped object for lineData in the ZigZag rendering code could contain time: undefined, which is not permitted by LineData<Time>. To fix this, you need to ensure only defined time values are included. There is no type guard after mapping. You should filter before mapping or add a type guard assertion after mapping.

Replace this block:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints
  .filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
  .map((p) => ({
    time: timeData[p.index],
    value: p.price,
  }));
```

With:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints
  .map((p) => {
    const time = timeData[p.index];
    if (time === undefined) return undefined;
    return { time, value: p.price };
  })
  .filter((d): d is LineData<Time> => d !== undefined);
```

This ensures lineData contains only valid LineData<Time> objects. Apply the same approach for similar mapping/filtering logic in peakData and bottomData within the same file if needed.
