The job failed due to TypeScript errors in components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx, specifically at lines 184, 215, and 246. The error message is:

Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }[]' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>[]'. Type 'Time | undefined' is not assignable to type 'Time'.

This happens because timeData[p.index] can be undefined, but the LineData type expects time to always be defined. To fix this, ensure that only elements where timeData[p.index] is defined are included.

You are already filtering for undefined timeData:

```tsx
.filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
.map((p) => ({
  time: timeData[p.index],
  value: p.price,
}));
```

However, TypeScript does not eliminate the possibility of undefined in .map(), so you should add a type assertion or create the mapped object within a .reduce() for stronger type safety.

Here's how you could change the relevant block, for example at line 184:

Replace:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints
  .filter((p) => timeData[p.index] !== undefined)
  .map((p) => ({
    time: timeData[p.index],
    value: p.price,
  }));
```

With:

```tsx
const lineData: LineData<Time>[] = allPoints.reduce<LineData<Time>[]>(
  (arr, p) => {
    const t = timeData[p.index];
    if (t !== undefined) arr.push({ time: t, value: p.price });
    return arr;
  },
  []
);
```

Apply the same pattern to the code at lines 215 and 246 ([see here](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/bc174a29b3de6fc1a87b1b6b119e8a43673511be/components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx#L215) and [here](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/bc174a29b3de6fc1a87b1b6b119e8a43673511be/components/charts/pro-indicator-overlay.tsx#L246)) for peaks and bottoms.

This change prevents undefined from being passed as the time property and resolves the TS2322 error.
