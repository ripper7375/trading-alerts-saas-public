The failure is caused by a type mismatch when assigning details in lib/disbursement/services/transaction-logger.ts on line 37. The code assigns entry.details (a Record<string, unknown>) to a Prisma JSON field that expects InputJsonValue | NullableJsonNullValueInput | undefined.

To fix this, change the assignment to pass entry.details as (entry.details ?? {}) as Prisma.JsonValue or simply as Prisma.InputJsonValue if available in your version:

```typescript
import { PrismaClient, AuditLogStatus, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
// ...
await this.prisma.disbursementAuditLog.create({
  data: {
    action: entry.action,
    status: entry.status,
    details: (entry.details ?? {}) as Prisma.InputJsonValue,
    transactionId: entry.transactionId,
    batchId: entry.batchId,
    actor: entry.actor,
    ipAddress: entry.ipAddress,
    userAgent: entry.userAgent,
  },
});
```

This ensures proper typing for details and will resolve the compilation error. See the change in context: lib/disbursement/services/transaction-logger.ts (ref: d4ce850945e5158ac8a59d358a96bec6caecf5a0).
