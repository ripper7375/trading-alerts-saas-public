I'll analyze the failing job 58752256966 to find the issue and provide a solution. The job failed because one or more upstream test jobs failed. Let me get more details about the pull request to see which specific tests failed: The job that's failing is a summary/aggregation job in your test workflow. The logs show it's detecting that "One or more test jobs failed" and exiting with code 1. However, the logs for this specific job don't show which upstream test job actually failed.

Please check the workflow file to understand the job dependencies.
