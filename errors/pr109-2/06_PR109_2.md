The failing job 59030627899 failed because one or more dependent test jobs did not pass, triggering this step in .github/workflows/tests.yml:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

This means either the Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, or Build Check job failed. To address the failing job:

1. Review the logs for unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check to locate which specific job failed and why.
2. Address the underlying issue in the failed job (common culprits: test failures, lint/type errors, dependency installation problems, or the production build size exceeding 360MB).

Code suggestion for debugging:

- Start by examining the test, lint, and build step outputs from each job.
- For build size errors, consider reducing dependencies or optimizing the build.

Fix the root cause in the failed job to resolve the test-summary failure.
