The failing job error is:

app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx(36,9): error TS6133: 'tierConfig' is declared but its value is never read.

Solution:
You are declaring tierConfig on line 36 but not using it anywhere. To fix the error, you can simply remove the unused variable declaration from your code. Update or remove line 36:

Before:

```tsx
const tierConfig = TIER_CONFIG[tier] ?? TIER_CONFIG.FREE;
```

After (just delete this line):

```tsx
// Removed unused tierConfig variable
```

Alternatively, if you intend to use tierConfig's properties for any display or logic, update your code to reference it properly. Otherwise, the clean solution is to remove the declaration.
