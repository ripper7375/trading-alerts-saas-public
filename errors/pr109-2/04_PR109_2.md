The job failed due to a TypeScript error:

app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx(36,9): error TS6133: 'tierConfig' is declared but its value is never read.

To resolve this, remove or use the unused variable tierConfig on line 36 in app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx (ref: 539581dbf48aafb3cafd6f968f12617785260d7c). If it's unnecessary, delete line 36:

```tsx
// Remove this line if not used
const tierConfig = TIER_CONFIG[tier] ?? TIER_CONFIG.FREE;
```

If you need to use tierConfig, reference it wherever tier data is accessed, or ensure it replaces the ternary logic used throughout the component. Otherwise, deleting the unused variable will fix the error and allow the build to pass.
