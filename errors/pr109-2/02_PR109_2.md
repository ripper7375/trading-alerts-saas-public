The job failed due to a linting error in app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx: the variable tierConfig is assigned but never used (line 36). To resolve this, remove the line:

```ts
const tierConfig = TIER_CONFIG[tier] ?? TIER_CONFIG.FREE;
```

if tierConfig is not needed, or, if you intend to use it, ensure it is utilized somewhere in the code. This will fix the @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars error and allow the job to pass.
