The failing job is caused by a TypeScript error on line 383 of app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts:

> Argument of type 'CachedData' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Record<string, unknown>'.
> Index signature for type 'string' is missing in type 'CachedData'.

This likely happens where the cached data is filtered with filterIndicatorData:

```typescript
const filteredData = filterIndicatorData(cachedData, userTier); // line 383
```

**Solution:**  
Ensure that CachedData (defined at line 372) is compatible with the expected parameter type of filterIndicatorData, which requires a Record<string, unknown>.

You can fix this by updating the CachedData type definition to include an index signature, or by explicitly casting cachedData to Record<string, unknown>. For clarity and type safety, do the following:

**Quick fix: Explicit Cast**

```typescript
const filteredData = filterIndicatorData(
  cachedData as Record<string, unknown>,
  userTier
);
```

Or, update the CachedData type:

```typescript
type CachedData = MT5IndicatorData & {
  proIndicatorsTransformed: ProIndicatorData;
  [key: string]: unknown; // <-- Add this line to ensure index signature
};
```

Make sure to apply this change at the definition in the file:

- [app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts@86c1bb6](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/86c1bb6134a8c69868f479fe02489322833dc365/app/api/indicators/%5Bsymbol%5D/%5Btimeframe%5D/route.ts#L372)

Implement either approach to resolve the type error and get a successful build.
