Here are focused solutions for the major failures in job 59015768247:

---

**1. Type Assignment Issues between `CachedData`, `Record<string, unknown>`, and `MT5IndicatorData`**

- Errors (e.g., route.ts:383, 393, 451, 464) are caused by using `CachedData` objects where `Record<string, unknown>` is expected, and vice versa. TypeScript expects either an index signature or matching required properties.
- Solution:
  - Add an index signature to `CachedData` and `MT5IndicatorData` interfaces, if feasible:
    ```ts
    interface CachedData {
      [key: string]: unknown;
      // existing props
    }
    interface MT5IndicatorData {
      ohlc: ...;
      // other properties
      [key: string]: unknown; // Add if you need flexible access
    }
    ```
  - Otherwise, explicitly cast variables or use type guards to ensure conformity:
    ```ts
    // When assigning or passing CachedData:
    someFunction(cachedData as Record<string, unknown>);
    // And vice versa when extracting
    const myData = data as CachedData;
    ```
  - Review the function signatures that trigger these errors and ensure the correct types are used (especially parameters and casting).

**2. Index Signature Property Access Errors (`TS4111`, `TS2339`)**

- Example: `lib/indicator-filter.ts` - Access properties from index signatures via bracket notation, not dot notation.
- Solution:
  - Change `.proIndicators` to `['proIndicators']` and `.proIndicatorsTransformed` to `['proIndicatorsTransformed']` everywhere you see these errors:
    ```ts
    // Instead of obj.proIndicators, use:
    obj['proIndicators'];
    // Instead of obj.proIndicatorsTransformed, use:
    obj['proIndicatorsTransformed'];
    ```
  - For TS2339 errors (e.g., line 117, 131) ensure the generic type `T` actually allows these properties; either extend with an appropriate interface or check their existence at runtime with type guards:
    ```ts
    if ('proIndicators' in obj) {
      /* safe to access */
    }
    ```

**3. Module Not Found (`TS2307`) in `alert-skeleton.tsx`**

- `"Cannot find module '@/components/ui/skeleton'"`
- Solution:
  - Ensure the file exists: `components/ui/skeleton.tsx` or similar.
  - If missing, create a dummy skeleton component, or update the import path to the correct location.
    ```tsx
    // If the file should exist, add it:
    // components/ui/skeleton.tsx
    export default function Skeleton() {
      return <div />;
    }
    ```
  - If it was moved/renamed, update the import in `alert-skeleton.tsx` accordingly.

**4. Property Not Present on Type (`TS2339`) in `indicator-filter.ts` line 271**

- `"Property 'upgradeMessage' does not exist on type 'IndicatorUpgradeInfo | { upgradeRequired: boolean; lockedIndicators: ... }'"`
- Solution:
  - Use a type guard:
    ```ts
    if ('upgradeMessage' in upgradeInfo) {
      // access upgradeMessage safely
      showMessage(upgradeInfo.upgradeMessage);
    }
    ```
  - Or narrow the type appropriately.

---

**Summary of Code Suggestions**

- Add index signatures to types/interfaces if appropriate.
- Replace dot property access for index signature properties with bracket notation.
- Create or correct missing module files and update import paths.
- Ensure type guards are used when accessing union properties.

Most of these fixes should resolve type errors and restore TypeScript compiling in your workflow. If you need sample lines replaced directly, specify the failing file and line.
