The job failed because the "Test Summary" step detected that one or more of the required jobs (“Unit & Component Tests”, “Integration Tests”, or “Production Build Check”) did not succeed. The workflow's last step runs the following logic:

```bash
if [ "${{ needs.unit-and-component-tests.result }}" == 'failure' ] ||
   [ "${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" == 'failure' ] ||
   [ "${{ needs.build-check.result }}" == 'failure' ]; then
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

This means your solution depends on fixing whichever job failed upstream.

Recommended steps:

1. Check the earlier jobs (“Unit & Component Tests”, “Integration Tests”, “Production Build Check”) for error messages and logs.
2. Address any test failures, dependency errors, or build errors shown in those jobs.
3. After resolving the root cause, rerun the workflow.

If a test job is failing due to missing dependencies or incorrect commands, update the corresponding step in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` (ref: 86c1bb6134a8c69868f479fe02489322833dc365) to fix the issue. For example, ensure:

- `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` succeeds
- All required environment variables are set
- Tests and builds run successfully

Once the underlying failures are fixed, the summary job will complete without an exit code of 1.
