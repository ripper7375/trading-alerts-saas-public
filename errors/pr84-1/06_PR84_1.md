The job failed because one or more test jobs did not pass. According to the workflow definition in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 1820ccc468bc8c5ef8d4f167fde31cee6b9e957c), the step called "Fail if any test failed" checks the result of the "unit-and-component-tests," "integration-tests," and "build-check" jobs:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

This causes the summary job to fail if any prerequisite test job fails. The logs indicate both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were skipped, possibly because their dependencies ("unit-and-component-tests") failed.

Solution:

- Check why the "unit-and-component-tests" job is failing. Inspect its test output and address any test or TypeScript, ESLint, or Prisma issues.
- If you want the summary job not to fail when jobs are skipped or cancelled, modify the condition in the "Fail if any test failed" step to check for 'failure' only (not 'skipped' or 'cancelled'), or remove this step for debugging:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Change to:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Or, comment out the summary fail step for debugging:

```yaml
# - name: Fail if any test failed
#   if: ...
#   run: ...
```

But for a full solution, fix errors in the "unit-and-component-tests" job first, as that's likely the core source of the problem. Review and fix failing tests or code issues. Once those tests pass, the workflow will complete successfully.
