I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The build is failing due to ESLint errors for unused `request` parameters in two API route files. Let me check these files: ## Solution

The build is failing due to ESLint errors for unused function parameters. Both route handlers have a `request` parameter that isn't being used in the function body.

### Fix for `app/api/disbursement/affiliates/payable/route.ts`

On **line 27**, prefix the unused parameter with an underscore:

```typescript
export async function GET(
  _request: NextRequest
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

### Fix for `app/api/disbursement/riseworks/sync/route.ts`

On **line 29**, prefix the unused parameter with an underscore:

```typescript
export async function POST(
  _request: NextRequest
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

### Why this works

The ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` requires that unused arguments match the pattern `/^_/u` (start with an underscore). This is a common convention in TypeScript/JavaScript to explicitly indicate that a parameter is intentionally unused but must be present for the function signature (in this case, Next.js API route handlers).
