The job failed due to TypeScript errors in app/api/admin/users/route.ts related to user.sessions possibly being undefined (see errors at lines 172-173).

Solution:
Before accessing user.sessions, ensure that it is defined. Update the relevant code as follows:

```typescript
let lastLoginAt: Date | null = null;
if (user.sessions && user.sessions.length > 0 && user.sessions[0]) {
  const sessionExpiry = new Date(user.sessions[0].expires);
  lastLoginAt = new Date(
    sessionExpiry.getTime() - SESSION_DURATION_DAYS * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000
  );
}
```

This change checks for both the existence of user.sessions and its length before attempting to use it, which resolves the TS18048 error. For reference, see the code at ref de48bda5fa1313be12dcc13c4ab38f98d4c1299c.
