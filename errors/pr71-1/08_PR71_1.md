The job 58961668590 failed because one or more of the dependent test jobs ("Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Production Build Check") did not succeed. This is enforced by the final step in your workflow, which explicitly fails if any required job did not pass:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.build-check.result != 'success'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

(See lines 153-159 in .github/workflows/tests.yml at ref de48bda5fa1313be12dcc13c4ab38f98d4c1299c.)

To solve this, review and fix the underlying test failures in the "unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", or "build-check" jobs. Once those jobs all succeed, this summary job will also succeed. Common areas to check are:

- Failing or skipped tests in your test commands (e.g., `pnpm run test:ci`, `pnpm run test:integration`)
- Dependency installation issues (`pnpm install`)
- Type errors (`pnpm run type-check`)
- Lint errors (`pnpm run lint`)
- Production build size exceeding threshold

Check each job’s logs to identify the root cause. Fix errors in the corresponding code or configuration, then re-run the workflow.
