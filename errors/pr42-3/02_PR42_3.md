The job failed because of this error:
Type error: Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.  
at app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts line 86

Solution:  
You need to ensure that systemConfig is a valid property on the Prisma client. The error suggests that Prisma does not recognize a systemConfig model in your schema.

To fix this:

1. Check your prisma/schema.prisma file and verify there is a model called systemConfig. The model name should match the casing. For example:

```prisma
model systemConfig {
  key        String @id
  value      String
  updatedBy  String?
  updatedAt  DateTime
  // other fields as needed
}
```

2. If the model exists but uses a different casing (e.g., SystemConfig), you should reference it as prisma.systemConfig (lowercase "systemConfig" for model names in Prisma; Prisma auto-generates camelCase properties for model names).

3. If you recently added the model, run:

```
npx prisma generate
```

And ensure migrations are up to date:

```
npx prisma migrate dev
```

Code suggestion (if the model name in schema is SystemConfig, as is typical with Prisma):
Replace all occurrences of prisma.systemConfig with prisma.systemConfig (if your schema uses that exact name), or correct to the actual generated name.

If you need more help, please share your prisma/schema.prisma file for further guidance.
