The error is caused by the use of prisma.systemConfig in app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts, but the Prisma client type does not have a systemConfig property. This likely means your Prisma schema does not define a systemConfig model, or the generated Prisma client has not been updated after a schema change.

To resolve this:

1. Check your prisma/schema.prisma file and ensure you have defined a model like this:

```prisma
model SystemConfig {
  key        String   @id
  value      String
  updatedBy  String?
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
  // Other fields as needed
}
```

2. After confirming the model exists, regenerate your Prisma client:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

3. If the model name is different (such as Config instead of SystemConfig), update the code in route.ts to use the correct model:

Change all occurrences of prisma.systemConfig to the correct model name (e.g., prisma.config).

4. Commit your changes and re-run the workflow.

This should fix the error "Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'." You can view the error in context here: [route.ts#L86](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/b3f5c9b23517b7353300d4bd9ff01a1d1fc57ec9/app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts).
