The failure is caused by the test-summary job in .github/workflows/tests.yml, which checks if any of the dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed. The log shows:

❌ One or more test jobs failed
exit 1

According to the logs, both integration tests and build check were skipped, which means their needs results were not 'success'. By default, GitHub treats skipped jobs as neither success nor failure, so the summary fails.

Solution:
Update the test-summary Fail if any test failed step to handle skipped jobs as non-fatal. Replace:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.build-check.result != 'success'
```

with:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

This ensures the summary only fails if a job actually failed, and skips/slack (non-run) are not treated as errors. Review your pipeline to confirm which jobs are expected to be skipped and adjust job conditions to fit your needs.
