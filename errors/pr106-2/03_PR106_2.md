The failing job 59025760952 results from the test summary step detecting that at least one required test job did not succeed. The relevant step in .github/workflows/tests.yml is:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

This step runs if any of the jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed. The log shows both integration tests and build check were skipped, leading the summary to mark them as failures and trigger the exit 1.

To fix this, update your workflow so that skipped jobs are not treated as failures in the summary step. You can check for 'failure' explicitly and not treat 'skipped' as failed. Here’s how you can adjust the condition:

Replace:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

With:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
# Add an extra check to exclude 'skipped':
# e.g., needs.build-check.result == 'skipped'
```

Or better, rewrite the logic to only fail if the result is specifically 'failure', not 'skipped':

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

To:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

But ensure the jobs are not skipped unintentionally. If jobs are intentionally skipped, adapt the logic or workflow triggers so skipping is expected and doesn't signal failure.

Check your triggers and under what conditions jobs are skipped, then adjust either the triggers or use explicit status checks ('failure' only) for the test summary step.

Review and edit .github/workflows/tests.yml in the commit 0efe40b71d2f791d57b059928d40708fb94645c3 as needed to implement the solution.
