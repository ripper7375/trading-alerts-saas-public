The error is due to the use of prisma.userSession, which does not exist on the PrismaClient instance. This indicates the Prisma schema does not define a userSession model, or it is named differently (such as UserSession or session).

Solution:

1. Check your Prisma schema (schema.prisma) and confirm the model name. Most likely, the correct model is UserSession, not userSession.
2. Update all occurrences of prisma.userSession to prisma.userSession or the correct model name from your schema. Prisma model properties are camelCase of the model name.

Example fix (in lib/auth/session-tracker.ts, starting at line 177):

```typescript
// Incorrect
await prisma.userSession.upsert({ ... });

// Likely fix (if model is named UserSession)
await prisma.userSession.upsert({ ... });
```

If your model is named session or something else, use prisma.session instead.

Review your Prisma schema, update the model usage accordingly, and re-run your build.

Reference the implementation starting at line 177 in session-tracker.ts for all occurrences. You can view the relevant code here for your current ref:
