The job is failing due to TypeScript errors: Property 'userSession' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient' in lib/auth/session-tracker.ts at multiple lines (177, 211, 228, 259, 265, 291, 301, 332), all referencing prisma.userSession.

**Solution:**  
This error indicates that your Prisma schema does not define a userSession model, but your code attempts to access it as prisma.userSession.  
To resolve this, ensure your Prisma schema (usually schema.prisma) contains a model definition for userSession, for example:

```prisma
model userSession {
  id            String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId        String
  sessionToken  String?  @unique
  userAgent     String?
  ipAddress     String?
  browser       String?
  browserVersion String?
  os            String?
  osVersion     String?
  deviceType    String?
  country       String?
  city          String?
  region        String?
  isActive      Boolean
  lastActiveAt  DateTime
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt     DateTime
}
```

After updating the schema, run npx prisma generate to update your Prisma Client. For additional help, see the Prisma docs on adding models: https://pris.ly/d/prisma-schema.  
If userSession is named differently or managed in another service, adjust all prisma.userSession references to the appropriate model or client.
