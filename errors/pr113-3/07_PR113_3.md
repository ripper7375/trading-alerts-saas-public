The failing job 59048098899 triggered the message: "❌ One or more test jobs failed" because at least one of the required test jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed. However, the summary step itself does not detail which job failed or include root cause information.

To fix this, review the logs for the jobs unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check in your workflow at .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 43418e93098fa8127b8f25f33a417a461b18587b):

- Check the "Unit & Component Tests" (line 10).
- Check the "Integration Tests" (line 64).
- Check the "Production Build Check" (line 95).

Common solutions:

- Ensure all jobs complete successfully and none silently skip required steps.
- Ensure that the needs dependencies in job definitions (such as "needs: unit-and-component-tests") are correct and that earlier jobs do not fail or exit early.
- If the failure is due to test or lint errors, review and fix failed tests or linter errors in your repository.
- If bundle size exceeds 360MB, reduce dependencies or optimize build output as per the check in lines 126-135.

Once any upstream job issues are resolved, the summary step will no longer fail. For more specific fixes, check the detailed logs and error messages for the first failing upstream job.
