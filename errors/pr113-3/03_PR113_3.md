The job failed because of the following TypeScript error in lib/auth/session-tracker.ts at line 177:

Property 'userSession' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.

This likely means your Prisma schema does not define a userSession model, or it is defined with a different name (such as userSessions or UserSession).

Solution:

1. Check your Prisma schema (usually schema.prisma) for the session model name. It should look like:

model UserSession {
// model fields...
}

2. If your model is named UserSession, the correct Prisma client accessor will be prisma.userSession (lowercase, singular). If it's named something else (userSessions, sessions, etc.), you need to match that exact name (case-sensitive) in your code.

3. If the schema is correct and the model exists, run npx prisma generate to re-generate the client after making schema changes.

Code suggestion:

- If your model is named sessions, for example, update your code:

```typescript
// Change this:
await prisma.userSession.upsert({...})

// To this:
await prisma.sessions.upsert({...})
```

- Or, if the model does not exist, add it to your schema.prisma, run npx prisma migrate, and try again.

Reference: See code at line 177 in lib/auth/session-tracker.ts (ref 43418e93098fa8127b8f25f33a417a461b18587b).

After correcting the model name in your Prisma client call(s) or ensuring the model exists in schema.prisma, the build should pass.
