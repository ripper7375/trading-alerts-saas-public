The failing job (59048086869) errors are caused by attempting to access prisma.userSession, but PrismaClient does not have a userSession property. This typically means your Prisma schema does not define a userSession model, or you did not run prisma generate after adding the model.

**Solution:**

1. Check your prisma/schema.prisma file and confirm you have a model called userSession. If you do not, add a model definition similar to the following:

```prisma
model userSession {
  id            String   @id @default(uuid())
  userId        String
  sessionToken  String?  @unique
  userAgent     String?
  ipAddress     String?
  browser       String?
  browserVersion String?
  os            String?
  osVersion     String?
  deviceType    String?
  country       String?
  city          String?
  region        String?
  isActive      Boolean  @default(true)
  lastActiveAt  DateTime
  createdAt     DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt     DateTime
}
```

2. Run the following commands to migrate your DB and generate the client:

```sh
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate
```

3. Redeploy or re-run your workflow after the schema and client are updated.

If your schema already includes this model, simply re-run npx prisma generate to refresh your PrismaClient to include userSession.

Fixing this issue will resolve the TypeScript error "Property 'userSession' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'" in lib/auth/session-tracker.ts (see reference 43418e93098fa8127b8f25f33a417a461b18587b).
