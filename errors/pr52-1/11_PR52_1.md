Here are targeted solutions for the main errors causing the job to fail:

---

### 1. Type Assignment Error in app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts

**Error:**  
Type 'ProIndicatorData' is not assignable to type 'MT5ProIndicators & ProIndicatorData'.  
Types of property 'zigzag' are incompatible:  
Type 'ZigZagData | null' is not assignable to type '{ peaks: ...; bottoms: ...; } | undefined'.  
Type 'null' is not assignable to expected object or undefined.

**Solution:**  
If 'zigzag' can be null, update the type definition where this object is constructed, so it allows null:

- Change
  ```ts
  zigzag?: { peaks: ...; bottoms: ...; }
  ```
  to
  ```ts
  zigzag?: { peaks: ...; bottoms: ...; } | null
  ```
- Or, before assignment, ensure that you never assign `null`—use `undefined` instead:
  ```ts
  zigzag: zigzagValue ?? undefined;
  ```

### 2. Unused Variable in components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx

**Error:**  
'ZIGZAG_COLORS' is declared but its value is never read.

**Solution:**

- If not used, delete the line declaring `ZIGZAG_COLORS`.
- If it should be used, reference it in your code.

### 3. Argument Type Error in components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx

**Error:**  
Argument of type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }[]' is not assignable to parameter of type '(WhitespaceData<Time> | LineData<Time>)[]'.  
Type '{ time: Time | undefined; value: number; }' is not assignable to type 'LineData<Time>'.
Type 'undefined' is not assignable to type 'Time'.

**Solution:**

- Ensure `time` is always defined. If your data source can provide undefined times, filter or assign a default:
  ```ts
  const data = originalData.filter((d) => d.time !== undefined) as {
    time: Time;
    value: number;
  }[];
  ```
  Or, provide a default/fallback time value if allowed by your logic.

### 4. Code Coverage Upload Error

**Error:**  
None of the following appear to exist as files: ./coverage/lcov.info

**Solution:**

- Make sure your test runs generate a coverage report at ./coverage/lcov.info before running Codecov.
- Add the following to your test step if you use Jest:
  ```
  jest --coverage
  ```
