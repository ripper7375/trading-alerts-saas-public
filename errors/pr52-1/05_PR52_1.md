The job failed mainly due to a missing CRON_SECRET environment variable required in app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts. The relevant check is:

```typescript
if (!cronSecret) {
  console.error('CRON_SECRET not configured');
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Cron job not configured' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

To resolve this failure, set the CRON_SECRET environment variable in your GitHub Actions workflow or the appropriate deployment environment.

Code suggestion for GitHub Actions:
Add the following to the env: section or your workflow job definition in .github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml:

```yaml
env:
  CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}
```

Also, make sure that the CRON_SECRET is properly defined in your repository secrets.

Additionally, the test suite failed at:
GET /api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe] › should return indicator data for FREE tier with valid symbol/timeframe in **tests**/api/indicators.test.ts (line 311). This likely indicates a logic or mock issue with your indicator API. Review the test setup and ensure your mocks and route logic handle the FREE tier and symbol/timeframe combination as expected.

Key fixes:

- Define CRON_SECRET in Actions and deployment.
- Review and, if needed, adjust the test logic/mocks in **tests**/api/indicators.test.ts for FREE tier coverage.
