The job failed due to a TypeScript/ESLint error in components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx at line 87: "'ZIGZAG*COLORS' is assigned a value but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^*/u. @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars".

To resolve this, remove the unused ZIGZAG_COLORS constant if it is not needed, or rename it as \_ZIGZAG_COLORS if you intend to keep it for future use but not use it in the code. For example, you can delete these lines:

```tsx
const ZIGZAG_COLORS = {
  peaks: '#f23645', // Red for peaks
  bottoms: '#00c853', // Green for bottoms
} as const;
```

Or rename it:

```tsx
const _ZIGZAG_COLORS = {
  peaks: '#f23645',
  bottoms: '#00c853',
} as const;
```

This will resolve the lint error and allow the build to complete successfully. See the file for reference: components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx (ref: f913b651afffb2e594d78e70d95f774c90342066).
