The failing job is caused by an ESLint error in components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx: "'ZIGZAG*COLORS' is assigned a value but never used. Allowed unused vars must match /^*/u. @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars".

To resolve this, you have two options:

**1. Remove the unused ZIGZAG_COLORS constant if you don’t need it:**

```tsx
// Remove lines 87–90:
const ZIGZAG_COLORS = {
  peaks: '#f23645', // Red for peaks
  bottoms: '#00c853', // Green for bottoms
} as const;
```

**2. Prefix the variable with an underscore (recommended if you plan to use it later):**

```tsx
const _ZIGZAG_COLORS = {
  peaks: '#f23645', // Red for peaks
  bottoms: '#00c853', // Green for bottoms
} as const;
```

Choose the approach that matches your intended use. This change will fix the TypeScript ESLint error and allow your workflow to pass. See the code in context here.
