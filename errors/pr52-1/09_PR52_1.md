The failure is caused by the "Test Summary" job, which is set to fail if any of the upstream jobs ("Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Production Build Check") do not succeed. In the logs, both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were skipped, which results in a non-success status for those jobs and triggers the summary step to fail with exit 1.

To fix this, update the test-summary job in your .github/workflows/tests.yml so it only fails if a required job actually failed, not if it was skipped. You can do this by explicitly checking for result == 'failure' instead of result != 'success'. Here’s how you can modify the relevant step:

```yaml
152|       - name: Fail if any test failed
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

This change ensures the summary will not fail if any job is skipped, only if a job explicitly fails. See the test-summary job in your workflow for where to apply this change ([link to code](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/f913b651afffb2e594d78e70d95f774c90342066/.github/workflows/tests.yml)).
