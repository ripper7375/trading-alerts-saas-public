The job failed because the lockfile’s specifiers do not match your package.json: specifically, 1 dependency (@playwright/test@^1.40.0) was added. This suggests that after updating package.json, you did not update package-lock.json, or you manually edited the lockfile.

**Solution:**  
Regenerate the lockfile to match your updated dependencies. Run this in your repository root:

```bash
pnpm install
# or if you're using npm:
# npm install
```

If you are using a CI that runs with the --frozen-lockfile flag (as in your workflow), this will ensure the lockfile matches package.json. Commit the updated package-lock.json to your branch.

**Summary of steps:**

1. Make sure package.json and package-lock.json are in sync.
2. Add and commit the new lockfile to your PR.

This will resolve the mismatch and allow the CI to pass.
