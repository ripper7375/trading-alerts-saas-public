The job failed because the specifiers in your lockfile (package-lock.json) do not match those in your package.json. Specifically, 1 dependency was added: @playwright/test@^1.40.0.

To fix this, update your lockfile to match the new package.json dependencies. Run the following command in your project root:

```sh
pnpm install
```

or, if you use npm:

```sh
npm install
```

Then commit both the updated package.json and package-lock.json files.

You can review the dependency change here:

- [package-lock.json (ref: e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0/package-lock.json)

Solution Summary:

- Run your package manager's install command to refresh the lockfile.
- Commit the changes so the lockfile matches package.json.
