The job failed because the package manager detected that the lockfile (pnpm-lock.yaml) is out of sync with package.json. Specifically, @playwright/test@^1.40.0 was added to package.json, but the lockfile does not reflect this.

**Solution:**

1. Run the following command locally to update the lockfile:

   ```
   pnpm install
   ```

   This will update pnpm-lock.yaml to match the changes in package.json.

2. Commit and push both the updated pnpm-lock.yaml and your package.json to the branch for the pull request.

**Optional: Add a CI guard**
If you want to avoid this in the future, consider adding a pre-commit or CI check that fails when the lockfile and package.json are out of sync.

- You can review your current package.json [here](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0/package.json).

- The pnpm-lock.yaml will be updated for this commit: `e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0`.

**Code suggestion:**
No changes to source code are required. Just update and commit your lockfile as described.
