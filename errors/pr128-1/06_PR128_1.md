The failure was caused by a mismatch between package.json and your lockfile: "@playwright/test@^1.40.0" was added to package.json, but this change wasn't reflected in package-lock.json. To resolve this:

1. Run npm install after updating package.json to regenerate/update package-lock.json.
2. Commit both package.json and package-lock.json together.

If you're using pnpm, make sure to use pnpm install and commit pnpm-lock.yaml accordingly.

Example steps:

```sh
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Sync lockfile after adding @playwright/test"
```

Or with pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Sync pnpm lockfile after adding @playwright/test"
```

This will fix the lockfile inconsistency and allow the CI job to pass.
