The job failed due to the final "Test Summary" step, which runs this command:

```bash
if needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
   needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
   needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
then
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

Based on the logs, both the Integration Tests and Build Check were skipped. This likely happens because the workflow is designed to only run these jobs on certain branches (main, develop, claude/\*\*), and your pull request may not match these branches.

To fix the issue, update the jobs matrix or workflow triggers in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0) to include the branch for your pull request. For example, if your pull request is from a feature branch, update the pull_request trigger like this:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, claude/**, '**']
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop, '**']
```

This change ensures all relevant jobs execute, so the summary step gets accurate results and does not fail unnecessarily.
