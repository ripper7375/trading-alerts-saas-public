The failing job's log indicates the following specific error:

> specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
>
> - 1 dependencies were added: @playwright/test@^1.40.0

This means that your lockfile (most likely package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml) is out of sync with your package.json. There is also an added dependency, `@playwright/test@^1.40.0`, in package.json, but it is not yet recorded in the lockfile.

## Solution

1. **Update the Lockfile**

   Run the package manager install command locally to update the lockfile with the newly added dependency.

   For npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   For yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   For pnpm:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

2. **Commit the Updated Lockfile**

   After running the install command, commit the changes to the lockfile (for example, `package-lock.json`):

   ```bash
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "chore: update lockfile with @playwright/test@^1.40.0"
   git push
   ```

## Additional Note

If you use a tool or workflow that enforces lockfile/package.json consistency, always ensure you commit both files together when adding, updating, or removing dependencies.

---

If you want direct code suggestions for your workflow, add a step before your tests to verify the lockfile is up to date. For npm:

```yaml
- name: Check for lockfile consistency
  run: npm install --package-lock-only
```

But in this case, updating and committing the lockfile should resolve your immediate CI failure.
