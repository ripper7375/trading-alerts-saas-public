The failing job occurred because the dependency @playwright/test@^1.40.0 was added to package.json under devDependencies, but the corresponding lockfile package-lock.json is not up to date with this change. This causes a mismatch between the lockfile and the manifest.

**Solution:**
Regenerate your lockfile to ensure it matches the current package.json. In your repository root, run:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, commit and push the updated package-lock.json. This will synchronize the lockfile with the package.json addition of @playwright/test@^1.40.0.

**Summary of changes that caused the failure:**

- @playwright/test@^1.40.0 exists in package.json devDependencies ([view code](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0/package.json#L110)), but is missing or out of sync in the lockfile ([view lockfile](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/e9a9df8f4e6d75136f2d7a24c260625831691ee0/package-lock.json)).

Committing the regenerated lockfile will resolve the error and the dependencies security scan will pass.
