The failure is caused by a mismatch between your package.json and package-lock.json: the dependency @playwright/test@^1.40.0 was added in package.json but not reflected in package-lock.json. Your workflow runs pnpm install --frozen-lockfile, which requires the lockfile to match package.json exactly.

**Solution:**  
Regenerate your package-lock.json to match your updated dependencies:

1. Run:
   ```
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Commit the updated package-lock.json to your branch.

This will resolve the lockfile/dependency mismatch and fix the failing job.

**Summary:**  
Anytime you add or update a dependency in package.json, always regenerate and commit package-lock.json to keep them in sync.
