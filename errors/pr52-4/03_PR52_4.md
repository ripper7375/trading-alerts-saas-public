The job failed because the Test Summary workflow step checks if any of the required jobs (Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, or Build Check) did not succeed, and then explicitly fails with exit 1 if any did not. The logs show that both "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" jobs were "skipped," which caused the failure.

Solution:

1. Ensure all dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) are enabled and not skipped for the current workflow run. Skipping (for example, via conditions or workflow filtering) will always result in a summary failure.
2. If you need to conditionally skip tests (e.g., for documentation PRs), update the Test Summary step in [.github/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/2a2d3bef69fc8ca0171fd9f044a5fa4f47c5c0af/.github/workflows/tests.yml) to properly handle skipped jobs, for example:

   ```yaml
   - name: Fail if any test failed
     if: |
       needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
       needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
       needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
     run: |
       echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
       exit 1
   ```

   This way, only actual job failures—not skips—cause the summary job to fail.

3. Review your branch and workflow triggers to ensure that all necessary jobs are running as expected for the PR.

If you want skipping to be allowed for certain PRs, consider updating the summary logic or your workflow triggers accordingly.
