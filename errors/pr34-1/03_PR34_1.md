I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The build is failing due to an unused TypeScript interface `PrismaUserWithCounts` defined on line 46. ESLint is enforcing the `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` rule, which requires unused variables to be prefixed with an underscore.

### Fix

Remove the unused interface since the code doesn't use it anywhere:

**File: `app/api/admin/users/route.ts`**

Delete lines 46-58:

```typescript
// Remove this entire interface block:
interface PrismaUserWithCounts {
  id: string;
  name: string | null;
  email: string;
  tier: string;
  role: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  _count: {
    alerts: number;
    watchlists: number;
  };
}
```

The code already handles the Prisma query results inline without needing this type definition. After removing these lines, the build should pass successfully.
