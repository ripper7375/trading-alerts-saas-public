The failing job errored due to TypeScript warnings:

- lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts(18,3): error TS6133: 'sendUpgradeEmail' is declared but its value is never read.
- lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts(19,3): error TS6133: 'sendCancellationEmail' is declared but its value is never read.

These indicate that sendUpgradeEmail and sendCancellationEmail are imported but not used in lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts (see lines 18–19). To resolve the failure, remove these unused imports:

Replace this import (lines 18–24):

```typescript
import {
  sendUpgradeEmail,
  sendCancellationEmail,
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

with:

```typescript
import {
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

This will eliminate the TS6133 errors and allow the job to pass. See the file at this ref for details: lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts@8e07e6af7183527dc86467af671a2ee697149d03.
