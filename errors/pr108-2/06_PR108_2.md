The job failed due to two TypeScript errors in lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts:

- Line 18: 'sendUpgradeEmail' is declared but its value is never read.
- Line 19: 'sendCancellationEmail' is declared but its value is never read.

To resolve this, remove the unused imports sendUpgradeEmail and sendCancellationEmail from the following import statement:

```typescript
import {
  sendUpgradeEmail,
  sendCancellationEmail,
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

Update it to:

```typescript
import {
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

This will fix the build and resolve the job failure caused by unused variables. See the source file here (commit 8e07e6af7183527dc86467af671a2ee697149d03): lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts.
