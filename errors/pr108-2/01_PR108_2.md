The failing job is caused by ESLint errors in lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts:

- Line 18: 'sendUpgradeEmail' is defined but never used.
- Line 19: 'sendCancellationEmail' is defined but never used.

To resolve this, remove the unused imports from the email module:

```typescript
// Remove these lines:
import {
  sendUpgradeEmail,
  sendCancellationEmail,
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';

// Replace with only the used exports:
import {
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

Or, if you need to keep them for future use, prefix the variable names with an underscore (e.g., \_sendUpgradeEmail) to satisfy the eslint rule.

See the relevant file: lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts (ref: 8e07e6af7183527dc86467af671a2ee697149d03).
