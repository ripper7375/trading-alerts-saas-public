The build is failing due to ESLint errors in lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts:

- 'sendUpgradeEmail' is defined but never used.
- 'sendCancellationEmail' is defined but never used.

Solution:  
Remove the unused imports from lib/stripe/webhook-handlers.ts to resolve these errors.  
Specifically, delete or comment out the following lines:

```typescript
import {
  sendUpgradeEmail,
  sendCancellationEmail,
  // other imports...
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

Keep only the imported functions that are actually used in the file. For your code, update the import to:

```typescript
import {
  sendPaymentFailedEmail,
  sendPaymentReceiptEmail,
  sendSubscriptionCanceledEmail,
  sendAffiliateCommissionEmail,
} from '@/lib/email/subscription-emails';
```

This will resolve the ESLint errors and allow the build to succeed.
