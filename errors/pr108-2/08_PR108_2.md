The job failed because the "test-summary" step includes this conditional block:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

From the logs, both integration tests and build check jobs were skipped or did not run successfully. This triggers the summary job to exit with an error.

Solution:

- Ensure that each of the required jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) actually runs. If you want to skip certain jobs, adjust the conditional in "test-summary" to not fail when those jobs are skipped:

Replace:

```yaml
needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

with:

```yaml
needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

(for jobs that can be skipped, also check for 'skipped' and do not fail)

Or, set default job results when a job is skipped:

```yaml
if: |
  (needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' && needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'skipped') ||
  (needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' && needs.integration-tests.result != 'skipped') ||
  (needs.build-check.result == 'failure' && needs.build-check.result != 'skipped')
```

This prevents the summary from failing when non-critical jobs are skipped.
