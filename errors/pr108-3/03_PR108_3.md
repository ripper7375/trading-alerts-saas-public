The failing job 59031541022 in your workflow is caused by the summary step in .github/workflows/tests.yml. The job exits with error if any of the individual test jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) fail:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

The log shows both "Integration Tests: skipped" and "Build Check: skipped" were output, which means those jobs didn’t run—likely because their dependencies did not succeed or were skipped. This can happen if previous jobs in the matrix were skipped or canceled.

Solution: Add conditional checks to skip the failure exit in the summary step when any of the dependent jobs were skipped instead of failed. Update the fail-if-any-test-failed step as follows:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|           # Exclude if result is 'skipped'
```

Or, for a more robust fix, modify the step to only fail if jobs actually failed, and not when they were skipped. For example:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           (needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure') ||
155|           (needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure') ||
156|           (needs.build-check.result == 'failure')
```

And ensure the earlier jobs can't be skipped unintentionally. Review branch filters and conditions causing job skips, and adjust your workflow triggers or dependencies as needed.
