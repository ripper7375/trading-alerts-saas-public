I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. Let me check the workflow file and understand the dependencies issue: ## Solution

The job is failing due to two issues:

### Issue 1: Lockfile Mismatch

The primary failure is caused by a mismatch between your `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package.json`. The CI uses `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` which fails when there are discrepancies.

**Fix:** Update your lockfile by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file.

### Issue 2: Missing Test Coverage File

The codecov step fails because it expects `coverage/lcov.info` but the test script doesn't generate coverage by default.

**Fix:** Update the test script in [`package.json`](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/827d10ac64be035f965584d191d0b6fad2e3da8b/package.json#L19):

```json
"test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage --maxWorkers=2 --silent",
```

Then update the workflow at [`.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml`](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/827d10ac64be035f965584d191d0b6fad2e3da8b/.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml#L247-L250) line 250:

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    echo "🧪 Running tests..."
    pnpm test:ci
    echo "✅ Tests passed"
  env:
    CI: true
```

This ensures coverage is generated in CI, which the codecov action can then upload. The codecov step already has `continue-on-error: true`, so it won't block the build if coverage upload fails.
