The job failed because the pnpm install step used --frozen-lockfile, but the lockfile and dependencies were out of sync. The logs also show a PostgreSQL error: "role 'root' does not exist," but this is not critical for your container as it's configured for the testuser role.

To fix the main issue, modify the Install dependencies step in your workflow to allow for lockfile updates in CI if necessary. Change:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  if: steps.check_project.outputs.project_exists == 'true'
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
```

to:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  if: steps.check_project.outputs.project_exists == 'true'
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

This will let pnpm install even if the lockfile is not perfectly synchronized, resolving the failed install.
