I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing due to a **lockfile mismatch**. The error indicates that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is out of sync with the dependencies specified in `package.json`.

## Solution

You need to regenerate the lockfile to match the current dependencies. Here's how to fix it:

### Steps:

1. **Locally regenerate the lockfile:**

   ```bash
   pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
   ```

2. **Commit the updated lockfile:**
   ```bash
   git add pnpm-lock.yaml
   git commit -m "Update pnpm-lock.yaml to match package.json"
   git push
   ```

This will update your `pnpm-lock.yaml` to reflect the current state of your dependencies in `package.json`, and the CI should pass on the next run.

### Why this happened:

The lockfile contains different dependency versions than what's declared in `package.json`. This typically occurs when:

- Dependencies were added/updated without updating the lockfile
- A merge conflict resolved incorrectly
- Manual edits to `package.json` without running `pnpm install`

The CI environment uses `--frozen-lockfile` by default (which prevents modifications to the lockfile), so it fails when it detects this mismatch rather than silently fixing it.
