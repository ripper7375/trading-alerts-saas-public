I'll analyze the failing job to identify the issue and provide a solution. The job is failing due to **frozen lockfile mismatch** in pnpm. The error indicates that the dependencies in your `pnpm-lock.yaml` don't match what's declared in your `package.json`.

## Solution

You need to update your lockfile to match your current dependencies. Run this locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

## What's happening

The CI environment runs `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` by default, which fails if there's any mismatch between `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. This ensures that the exact same dependencies are installed in CI as in development.

The lockfile appears out of sync with your declared dependencies (particularly around `@hookform/resolvers`, `@next-auth/prisma-adapter`, and related packages).

After you regenerate and push the lockfile, the tests should be able to run successfully. Note: The codecov error you see afterward is expected since the tests didn't run, so no coverage files were generated.
