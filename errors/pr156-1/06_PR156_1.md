I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution for Job Failure

The job is failing due to a **pnpm lockfile mismatch**. The error indicates that the dependencies in your `pnpm-lock.yaml` file don't match what's expected based on your `package.json`.

### Root Cause

```
"dependencies" in the lockfile ({... }) does not match the expected dependencies
```

This happens when your lockfile is out of sync with your package dependencies, and pnpm's frozen lockfile mode (enabled by default in CI) prevents the installation from proceeding.

### Solution

You need to regenerate your lockfile. Run this locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "fix: update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

### Why This Happened

Common causes:

- Dependencies were added/modified but the lockfile wasn't committed
- Manual edits to `package.json` without running `pnpm install`
- Merge conflicts that weren't properly resolved in the lockfile
- Different pnpm versions between local and CI (less likely but possible)

After pushing the updated lockfile, the CI should pass on the next run.
