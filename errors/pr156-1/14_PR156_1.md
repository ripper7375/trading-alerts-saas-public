I'll analyze the failing job to find the solution. Let me get the logs first. I can see the job is failing because of a lockfile mismatch in pnpm. Let me get more of the logs to see the full error: ## Solution for Failing Job

The job is failing due to a **lockfile mismatch** during `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`. The error indicates that the dependencies in your `pnpm-lock.yaml` file don't match what's expected based on your `package.json`.

### The Issue

The error message shows:

```
"dependencies" in the lockfile ({... }) doesn't match the dependencies in package.json
```

This happens when you've modified `package.json` (added/updated dependencies) but haven't regenerated the lockfile.

### Solution

You need to regenerate the lockfile. Run these commands locally:

```bash
# Delete the existing lockfile
rm pnpm-lock.yaml

# Reinstall dependencies to generate a new lockfile
pnpm install

# Commit the updated lockfile
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

### Alternative: Use `--no-frozen-lockfile` (Not Recommended for CI)

If you want to temporarily bypass this check (though not recommended for production workflows), you can modify line 36, 63, and 90 in `.github/workflows/security-checks. yml`:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

However, the **recommended approach** is to keep `--frozen-lockfile` in CI and ensure your lockfile is always up-to-date by regenerating it locally whenever you modify dependencies.
