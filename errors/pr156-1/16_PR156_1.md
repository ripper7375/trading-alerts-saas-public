I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. Let me get more details from the logs and check the workflow file:## Solution for Failing Job

The job is failing because there's a **lockfile mismatch** between `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `package.json`. The error indicates that pnpm is detecting dependency differences and refusing to install with the `--frozen-lockfile` flag in CI.

### Root Cause

The error message shows:

```
"dependencies" in the lockfile ({... }) doesn't match the expected value...
```

This occurs when dependencies in `package.json` have been modified but `pnpm-lock.yaml` hasn't been regenerated to reflect those changes.

### Solution

**Option 1: Regenerate the lockfile (Recommended)**

Run this locally to sync your lockfile:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

**Option 2: Temporary CI fix (Not recommended for production)**

If you need the CI to pass immediately while investigating, modify the workflow file at line 36:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/security-checks.yml (line 36)
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

However, **Option 1 is strongly preferred** because it ensures your dependencies are properly locked and reproducible across all environments.

### Why This Happened

This typically occurs when:

- Dependencies were added/updated but the lockfile wasn't committed
- Manual edits were made to `package.json` without running `pnpm install`
- Different versions of pnpm were used between local and CI environments

The `--frozen-lockfile` flag is intentionally strict in CI to prevent inconsistent builds.
