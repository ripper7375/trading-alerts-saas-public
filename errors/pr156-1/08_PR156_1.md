I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing due to a **pnpm lockfile mismatch** in CI. The error indicates that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is out of sync with your `package.json` dependencies.

## Solution

You need to regenerate the lockfile to match your current dependencies. Run this locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

## Why this happens

The lockfile contains dependency versions that don't match what's in your `package.json`. This commonly occurs when:

- Dependencies were added/updated without committing the lockfile changes
- Manual edits were made to `package.json` without running `pnpm install`
- Merge conflicts resolved incorrectly

## Alternative (if you need to bypass temporarily)

If you need to proceed without fixing the lockfile, you can modify your workflow file to use:

```yaml
- name: Install dependencies
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

However, **this is not recommended** for production as it can lead to inconsistent builds across environments. The proper fix is to commit the updated lockfile.
