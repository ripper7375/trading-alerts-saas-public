I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The security checks job failed because **three underlying jobs failed**: Dependency audit, Type check, and Linting. The summary job correctly aggregated these failures and exited with code 1.

### Root Causes:

1. **Dependency audit** - High/critical vulnerabilities found in dependencies
2. **Type check** - TypeScript compilation errors
3. **Linting** - ESLint errors

### Recommended Fixes:

#### 1. Fix Dependency Vulnerabilities

Run this to identify and fix vulnerable dependencies:

```bash
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
pnpm audit --fix
```

If automatic fixes aren't available, manually update the vulnerable packages or review the audit report to determine if the vulnerabilities are exploitable in your context.

#### 2. Fix TypeScript Errors

Run locally to see the specific type errors:

```bash
pnpm run type-check
```

Then fix each type error reported. Common issues include:

- Missing type definitions
- Incorrect prop types
- Unsafe `any` usage

#### 3. Fix Linting Errors

Run locally to see the specific linting issues:

```bash
pnpm run lint
```

You can auto-fix many issues with:

```bash
pnpm run lint --fix
```

### Verification Steps:

Before pushing, run all three checks locally to ensure they pass:

```bash
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
pnpm run type-check
pnpm run lint
```

Once all three commands succeed locally, push your changes and the security checks workflow should pass.
