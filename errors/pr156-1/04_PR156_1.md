I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The job is failing because `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` is detecting a mismatch between your `package.json` dependencies and the `pnpm-lock.yaml` lockfile. This happens when dependencies are updated in `package.json` but the lockfile hasn't been regenerated.

### Fix

Update the lockfile by running locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

### Alternative: Modify Workflow (Not Recommended for CI)

If you need a temporary workaround for the workflow, you could change line 56 in `.github/workflows/dependencies-security.yml`:

```yaml
# Change from:
- name: Install dependencies
  if: steps.check_npm.outputs.exists == 'true'
  run: pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# To:
- name: Install dependencies
  if: steps. check_npm.outputs.exists == 'true'
  run: pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile
```

However, **updating the lockfile locally is the correct approach** as it ensures dependency consistency across all environments.
