I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing due to a **pnpm lockfile mismatch**. The error indicates that the dependencies in `pnpm-lock.yaml` don't match the dependencies defined in `package.json`. This happens in CI environments where pnpm uses `--frozen-lockfile` by default.

## Solution

You need to regenerate the lockfile to match your current dependencies:

**Local fix:**

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will update `pnpm-lock.yaml` to match your `package.json`. Then commit and push the updated lockfile:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Fix:  Update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

**Why this happened:**

- Dependencies were added/updated/removed in `package.json` without updating the lockfile
- The lockfile is out of sync with the actual dependency tree

**To prevent this:**

- Always run `pnpm install` after modifying `package.json`
- Commit both `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml` together
- Consider adding a pre-commit hook to verify lockfile consistency

The CI will pass once the lockfile is synchronized with your dependencies.
