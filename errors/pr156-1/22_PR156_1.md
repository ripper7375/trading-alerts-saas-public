I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The log shows this is a summary job that failed because one or more test jobs failed. Let me get more details about the workflow and check all the jobs in this run: The failing job is the **Test Summary** job, which aggregates the results of the three test jobs. The logs show that one or more dependent test jobs failed, causing this summary job to fail at lines 175-176.

## Solution

The issue is that the `test-summary` job has `needs` dependencies on jobs that were skipped, not failed. When a job is skipped (likely due to a prior job failure), the workflow condition at lines 170-173 doesn't account for `'skipped'` status.

**Fix the workflow condition** to handle skipped jobs properly:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs. build-check.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'skipped' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'skipped' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'skipped'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

Or more concisely, check for success:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs. unit-and-component-tests. result != 'success' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs. build-check.result != 'success'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

**Root Cause**: One of the upstream jobs (`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, or `build-check`) actually failed. You'll need to check those individual job logs to see which one failed and why. The test-summary job is just reporting that failure.
