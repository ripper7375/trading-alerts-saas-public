I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The failure is related to a pnpm lockfile mismatch. The CI is detecting that the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is out of sync with the `package.json` dependencies. Let me check the workflow file to understand the setup: ## Solution

The job is failing because the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file is out of sync with your `package.json` dependencies. The error indicates that the lockfile doesn't match the current dependencies, and since this is running in CI (which defaults to `--frozen-lockfile`), it refuses to modify the lockfile.

**The fix:** Update your lockfile by running locally:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit and push the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile"
git push
```

**Why this happened:** Dependencies were added or changed in `package.json` but the lockfile wasn't regenerated. The `--frozen-lockfile` flag on [line 129](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/827d10ac64be035f965584d191d0b6fad2e3da8b/. github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml#L129) of your workflow prevents pnpm from automatically updating it in CI, which is the correct behavior to ensure reproducible builds.

After pushing the updated lockfile, the workflow will pass.
