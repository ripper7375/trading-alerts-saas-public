The main cause of the job failure is a missing CRON_SECRET environment variable in your environment. This is explicitly logged as:

> console.error  
> CRON_SECRET not configured  
> at app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts:24:13

Additionally, there are database errors in multiple admin API routes, but these are likely test-side issues related to missing DB configuration/mocks and not necessarily related to the CI failure itself. Also, your Codecov upload is failing due to a missing upload token, but that does not cause the test job to fail—it only affects coverage reporting.

**Solution:**

1. **Set the CRON_SECRET environment variable** in your CI/CD environment.
   - In GitHub Actions, go to your repository > Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
   - Add a new secret with the name CRON_SECRET and set its value accordingly.

2. To fix the Codecov warnings (optional, for coverage upload):
   - Add a CODECOV_TOKEN secret with your Codecov upload token.

**Code/Configuration update for .github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml:**

```yaml
# Add under jobs.<job_id>.env or jobs.<job_id>.steps.env if not present:
env:
  CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}
  # CODECOV_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.CODECOV_TOKEN }}  # Optional, if uploading coverage
```

Full example for a GitHub Actions job step:

```yaml
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}
    steps:
      # ...
```

- Ensure the secret is set and available in your repository before re-running the workflow.

**Summary of Required Actions:**

- Define CRON_SECRET in GitHub Actions.
- Optionally add CODECOV_TOKEN for proper Codecov uploads.

This should resolve the failing job. If you need help with DB configuration/mocking for tests, let me know.
