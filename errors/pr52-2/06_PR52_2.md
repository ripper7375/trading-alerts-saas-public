Your failing job is due to two TypeScript type errors:

1. In app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts at line 342, you are assigning proIndicators (of type ProIndicatorData) to a place expecting MT5ProIndicators & ProIndicatorData. The error is because ProIndicatorData.zigzag can be null, but MT5ProIndicators expects zigzag to be of type { peaks: ...; bottoms: ...; } | undefined, not null.

**Solution:**  
Modify the transformProIndicators function to return undefined for zigzag when it's not provided, rather than null.

Change this in transformProIndicators:

```typescript
zigzag: proData.zigzag
  ? {
      peaks: proData.zigzag.peaks || [],
      bottoms: proData.zigzag.bottoms || [],
    }
  : null,
```

to

```typescript
zigzag: proData.zigzag
  ? {
      peaks: proData.zigzag.peaks || [],
      bottoms: proData.zigzag.bottoms || [],
    }
  : undefined,
```

or update the relevant TypeScript type so that null is allowed wherever this value is used.

2. In components/charts/indicator-overlay.tsx at line 446, you are passing an array of objects with time: Time | undefined, value: number to a function expecting time: Time, i.e., time cannot be undefined.

**Solution:**  
Filter out data points with undefined time before passing to the charting library.

Locate code similar to:

```typescript
const lineData = points.map((point) => ({
  time: point.time as Time,
  value: point.value,
}));
lineSeries.setData(lineData);
```

Instead, filter out entries with undefined time:

```typescript
const lineData = points
  .map((point) => ({
    time: point.time as Time,
    value: point.value,
  }))
  .filter(
    (d): d is { time: Time; value: number } =>
      d.time !== undefined && d.value !== undefined
  );

lineSeries.setData(lineData);
```

This pattern should also be applied anywhere else you create lineData that uses Time.

Apply these fixes and the type errors should be resolved.
