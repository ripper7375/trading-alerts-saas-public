The failure in job 58910718168 is caused by one or more of the earlier test jobs not completing successfully. The .github/workflows/tests.yml workflow’s test-summary job runs these lines:

```bash
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.build-check.result != 'success'
run: |
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
```

This means if any of unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check fail, the summary job fails with exit code 1.

To provide a solution:

1. Check the detailed outputs and logs of each of these jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) on the same run.
2. Fix the failing job by addressing the specific test error or build problem indicated in that job’s log.
3. Once all test/bundle jobs are successful, the summary job will succeed.

If the jobs were intentionally skipped and shouldn’t block the workflow, adjust the conditions in the test-summary job, or review why they are marked as failed/skipped.

You might add debugging output with this in mind to the test steps, or adjust the job dependencies if it’s a workflow design issue. For example, ensure that if a job is skipped for an expected reason, the workflow YAML provides fallback values to avoid recording it as a failure:

```yaml
if: always()
```

for summary steps is appropriate, but the job still checks for any failure in previous jobs.

Review the logs for each dependent job to pinpoint actual failures and apply necessary fixes to the related code or configuration. The core solution is: fix the root issue in the dependent job(s) that did not succeed.
