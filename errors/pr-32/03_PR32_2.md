I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The build is failing because the `request` parameter on line 52 is declared but never used in the function body. TypeScript is enforcing strict rules about unused variables.

**Fix:** Remove the unused `request` parameter from the function signature.

Change line 51-53 from:

```typescript
export async function GET(
  request:  NextRequest,
  context: RouteParams
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

To:

```typescript
export async function GET(
  _request: NextRequest,
  context:  RouteParams
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

**Alternative:** If you don't need the request parameter at all, you can remove it entirely and adjust the function signature. However, Next.js route handlers expect this signature, so prefixing with an underscore is the cleanest solution as it indicates the parameter is intentionally unused while maintaining the correct function signature.

This change tells TypeScript that the parameter is intentionally unused, which will resolve the compilation error.
