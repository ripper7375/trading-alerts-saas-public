I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The logs show a summary job failed but I need to see the actual test failures. Let me get the full workflow run logs to identify which specific test failed. The failing job is a summary/status check job that reports "❌ One or more test jobs failed". This indicates that the actual failure is in one of the dependent test jobs, not in this job itself.

**Solution:**

You need to check the other jobs in the same workflow run to identify which specific test failed. The job logs show that:

- Integration Tests: skipped
- Build Check: skipped

This suggests that an earlier job (likely Unit Tests or another test job) failed, causing subsequent jobs to be skipped and this summary job to fail.

**To fix this:**

1. Navigate to the full workflow run for PR #32 and identify which test job actually failed (look for jobs with a red X before this summary job)
2. Check the logs of that failing job to see the actual error
3. The summary job itself is working as intended - it's designed to fail when any dependency fails

If you'd like, I can help analyze the specific failing test job if you provide its job ID or if you share which test is failing from the Actions tab.
