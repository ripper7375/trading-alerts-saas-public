I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The build is failing due to **ESLint errors** for unused variables. Here's the solution:

## Fix Required

You have 3 unused variables that need to be prefixed with an underscore:

### 1. `app/api/disbursement/config/route.ts` (line 48)

```typescript
// Change:
export async function GET(request: Request) {

// To:
export async function GET(_request: Request) {
```

### 2. `app/api/disbursement/health/route.ts` (line 39)

```typescript
// Change:
export async function GET(request:  Request) {

// To:
export async function GET(_request: Request) {
```

### 3. `lib/disbursement/cron/disbursement-processor.ts` (line 15)

```typescript
// Change:
import { DisbursementProvider } from '.. .';

// To either:
import { DisbursementProvider as _DisbursementProvider } from '...';

// Or remove the import if it's not needed:
// (delete the import statement entirely)
```

The ESLint rule `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` requires unused parameters and variables to be prefixed with an underscore (`_`). This convention signals that the variable is intentionally unused.
