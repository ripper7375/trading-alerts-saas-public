The Security Checks workflow failed on the "TypeScript Type Check" and "ESLint Security Check" steps, according to the logs:

- ❌ Type check: FAILED
- ❌ Linting: FAILED

This means your codebase currently does not pass either type-checking or linting. Here are focused solutions:

1. **Type Check Solution**  
   The type check uses the script:

   ```sh
   pnpm run type-check
   # This executes: "prisma generate && tsc --noEmit"
   ```

   To diagnose errors locally, run:

   ```sh
   pnpm install
   pnpm run type-check
   ```

   Review and resolve any TypeScript errors shown in your terminal. Your `tsconfig.json` is in strict mode with many strict rules, so all type issues (including from missing/incorrect typings, unused variables, or implicit anys) must be corrected.

2. **Lint Solution**  
   Linting runs with:
   ```sh
   pnpm run lint
   # This executes: "next lint"
   ```
   To review problems, run:
   ```sh
   pnpm run lint
   ```
   This will list all code style and potential security issues flagged by ESLint. To automatically fix what can be auto-fixed:
   ```sh
   pnpm run lint:fix
   ```
   Then, manually fix any remaining lint violations.

**Suggestions:**

- Fix all TypeScript errors, especially focusing on types and unused variables as enforced by your strict config.
- Fix all lint errors shown by `next lint`.
- Commit your changes and push to your PR. The checks should pass if type errors and lint errors are resolved.
