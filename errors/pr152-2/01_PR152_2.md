The job failed due to two main issues in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx:

1. **Lint Error: Unescaped Character (react/no-unescaped-entities)**
   - Error: `'` can be escaped with &apos;, &lsquo;, &#39;, &rsquo;`
   - Solution: Locate any string containing an unescaped `'` character in JSX and replace it with `&apos;` or another valid HTML entity, or wrap the string with double quotes instead of single quotes to avoid escaping, for example:

   ```tsx
   // Before
   <p>You can't reset your password here</p>
   // After
   <p>You can&apos;t reset your password here</p>
   ```

2. **Image Optimization Warning**
   - Warning: Using `<img>` could result in slower LCP and higher bandwidth. Consider using `<Image />` from `next/image`.
   - Solution: Replace usages of the regular <img> tag with Next.js's optimized Image component. For example:

   ```tsx
   // Before (line 640)
   <img src={qrCode} alt="2FA QR Code" className="h-48 w-48" />;
   // After
   import Image from 'next/image';
   //...
   <Image
     src={qrCode}
     alt="2FA QR Code"
     width={192}
     height={192}
     className="h-48 w-48"
   />;
   ```

After making these changes in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx (ref: 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a), the build and linting should pass.

Additionally, Postgres is logging repeated errors about the role "root" not existing. This suggests a misconfigured database client or test script. Ensure all connections use the test user `testuser` defined in your workflow and environment variables.
