The job failed due to an ESLint error in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx:

Error at line 730:
'`' can be escaped with &apos;, &lsquo;, &#39;, &rsquo;. react/no-unescaped-entities

This is caused by the string:
"You won't be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once."

To fix the error, escape the apostrophe in "won't" like this:

```tsx
<p className="mt-1 text-sm text-amber-700 dark:text-amber-300">
  You won&apos;t be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once.
</p>
```

Update line 730 in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx (ref: 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a) as shown to resolve the failure.
