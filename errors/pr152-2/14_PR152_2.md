The job failed because one or more test jobs did not pass in your workflow. Your current workflow's final "Test Summary" and "Fail if any test failed" steps will cause a failure if any of these upstream jobs return failure. To address this, check which jobs are failing: typically, it's the Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, or Production Build Check defined in your tests.yml.

Here's how to solve the issue:

1. Look at the results for the jobs unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check to identify which one failed. Each job reports its status to the test-summary step.
2. View the logs for the specific job that failed; the relevant code is in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a).
3. Once you've found the failing job, address the root cause in its corresponding steps. Common fixes:
   - For failed TypeScript, ESLint, or tests, fix code errors or test failures locally and push again.
   - If bundle size is too large in the build-check, reduce dependencies or optimize your build output as described in the "Check bundle size" step in your workflow:
     ```sh
     # Example for lowering production build size in Next.js
     # Remove unnecessary dependencies and optimize imports
     ```

If you want to make the workflow report more clearly, you can add specific logging or error messages within failing steps to simplify debugging for each job.

For further debugging, read each job log (especially lines after "pnpm run lint", "pnpm run type-check", "pnpm run test:ci", or "pnpm run build") for errors to fix directly in your codebase or configuration. Make sure all jobs complete successfully before the summary step runs.
