The job failed due to two issues in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx:

1. Warning about using <img>:  
   Line 640 uses <img src={qrCode} alt="2FA QR Code" ... />. For Next.js, replace <img> with the <Image /> component from next/image to optimize loading and performance.

**Solution:**  
Import Image from 'next/image', and replace:

```tsx
<img src={qrCode} alt="2FA QR Code" className="h-48 w-48" />
```

with:

```tsx
import Image from 'next/image';
// ...
<Image
  src={qrCode}
  alt="2FA QR Code"
  width={192}
  height={192}
  className="h-48 w-48"
/>;
```

2. Error: Unescaped single quote (react/no-unescaped-entities):  
   Line 730 contains:

```tsx
You won't be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once.
```

The single quote in "won't" must be escaped.

**Solution:**  
Replace the single quote with &apos; or &#39;:

```tsx
You won&apos;t be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once.
```

Apply these changes in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx on ref 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a to resolve the CI errors.
