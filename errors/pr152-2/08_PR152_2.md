The lint job failed due to two ESLint issues in app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx (ref: 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a):

1. Usage of <img> (line 640): Using <img> directly may negatively impact performance. Replace it with Next.js's <Image> component.
   - Replace:
     ```tsx
     <img src={qrCode} alt="2FA QR Code" className="h-48 w-48" />
     ```
     With:
     ```tsx
     import Image from 'next/image';
     ...
     <Image src={qrCode} alt="2FA QR Code" width={192} height={192} className="w-48 h-48" />
     ```
     (Adjust width/height as appropriate.)

2. Unescaped single quote (line 730): `'` must be HTML-escaped.
   - Replace:
     ```tsx
     You won't be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once.
     ```
     With:
     ```tsx
     You won&apos;t be able to see them again. Each code can only be used once.
     ```

Correct these issues to resolve the failing lint job. See the file here: [app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx@8a80d2c](<https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a/app/(dashboard)/settings/security/page.tsx>)
