The job failed due to TypeScript errors about missing properties on the User type, such as twoFactorEnabled, twoFactorSecret, twoFactorBackupCodes, and twoFactorVerifiedAt. According to your prisma/schema.prisma (ref 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a), these properties are present in the User model:

- twoFactorEnabled: Boolean
- twoFactorSecret: String?
- twoFactorBackupCodes: String?
- twoFactorVerifiedAt: DateTime?

This suggests your database schema is correct, but your application’s TypeScript User type is out of sync.

**Solution:**

1. Update your TypeScript definition for the User type (e.g., types/User.ts or equivalent) to include these 2FA-related properties:

```ts
export interface User {
  // ...existing fields
  twoFactorEnabled: boolean;
  twoFactorSecret?: string;
  twoFactorBackupCodes?: string;
  twoFactorVerifiedAt?: Date;
}
```

2. If you generate your types (e.g., using Prisma), re-generate the Prisma client:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

3. Ensure all imports and usages reference the correct User type.

**Additionally:**  
There is an issue in app/(auth)/verify-2fa/page.tsx (ref 8a80d2c6a327b3b1d0096197f0c5c66f6b25412a) at line 69:  
`error TS2322: Type 'string | undefined' is not assignable to type 'string'.`  
This means a value that could be undefined is being assigned where only a string is allowed. Make sure all variables typed as string are initialized to a string, or allow undefined in the type.

**Example fix:**

```ts
const value: string = possiblyUndefinedValue ?? '';
```

or

```ts
const value: string | undefined = possiblyUndefinedValue;
```

These changes should resolve the compilation and type errors.
