The job failed due to the "Build Check" step, specifically the following check in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: cdf0b85ed3c37677c47714474a01d7270a5c2654):

```sh
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 365 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 365MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

This means your Next.js build output exceeded the 365MB threshold. To resolve this:

1. Review your `.next/` folder after build to identify large files, unused assets, or modules.
2. Remove or optimize unnecessary code, images, and dependencies.
3. Consider using Next.js image optimization, dynamic imports, or splitting large UI components.
4. Re-run `pnpm run build` and check the bundle size.

If you need more granularity, tools like webpack-bundle-analyzer can help pinpoint size bottlenecks. Reduce the output below 365MB to pass the build check.
