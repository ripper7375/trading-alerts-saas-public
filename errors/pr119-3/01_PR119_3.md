The failing job 59055354973 is caused by the production build's bundle size exceeding the threshold set in your workflow. According to the logs, the built Next.js bundle is 366MB, while the allowed limit is 365MB.

**Solution:**  
Reduce the bundle size to be below 365MB. Here are code and configuration suggestions:

1. **Analyze Bundle:**  
   Run `pnpm run analyze` or add `next build --profile` to generate a bundle report. Identify large dependencies, duplicate packages, or unnecessary assets.

2. **Optimize Dependencies:**
   - Remove unused dependencies from your package.json.
   - Use dynamic imports and modularize vendor code.
   - Replace heavy libraries with lighter alternatives.

3. **Configure Next.js for Production:**  
   In your `next.config.js`, enable these optimizations:

   ```js
   const nextConfig = {
     optimizeFonts: true,
     optimizeImages: true,
     experimental: {
       serverActions: true,
     },
     webpack: (config, { isServer }) => {
       // Add bundle analyzer plugin
       if (process.env.ANALYZE) {
         const { BundleAnalyzerPlugin } = require('webpack-bundle-analyzer');
         config.plugins.push(new BundleAnalyzerPlugin());
       }
       return config;
     },
   };
   module.exports = nextConfig;
   ```

4. **Clear `.next` Directory Before Building:**  
   Make sure old build artifacts are not included in the size check. Add a step before build:

   ```yaml
   - name: Clean .next directory
     run: rm -rf .next
   ```

5. **Increase Threshold (Optional):**  
   If further optimization isn't possible and the size change is justified, you can cautiously raise the limit in `.github/workflows/tests.yml`:
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/tests.yml, line 130-131
   if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 370 ]; then  # <-- increased threshold
     echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 370MB"
     exit 1
   fi
   ```

For best results, focus on reducing code and assets rather than raising the limit.  
Full reference to the build size check is in your workflow:

**Summary:**

- Reduce the build size to below the limit with dependency and code optimizations.
- Optionally, increase the workflow's threshold as a temporary measure.
- Use bundle analysis tools to identify and address the cause.
