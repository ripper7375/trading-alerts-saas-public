I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution

The TypeScript compiler is failing at **line 213** in `disbursement-processor.ts` with the error:

```
Type 'null' is not assignable to type 'string | NestedStringFilter<"AffiliateRiseAccount"> | undefined'.
```

The issue is on line 213 where you're filtering for `riseId:  { not: null }`. In strict TypeScript mode, `null` is not compatible with the expected Prisma filter type.

### Fix

Change line 213 from:

```typescript
riseId: { not: null },
```

to:

```typescript
riseId: { not: null as any },
```

Or better yet, use the proper Prisma filter syntax:

```typescript
where: {
  riseId:  { isSet: true },
},
```

Or if your Prisma version supports it:

```typescript
where: {
  NOT: {
    riseId:  null,
  },
},
```

**Recommended solution** (lines 211-215):

```typescript
const accounts = await this.prisma.affiliateRiseAccount.findMany({
  where: {
    NOT: {
      riseId: null,
    },
  },
});
```

This will properly filter for accounts that have a non-null `riseId` value while satisfying TypeScript's type checking.
