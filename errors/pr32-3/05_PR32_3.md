I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The TypeScript type check is failing at **line 213** in `lib/disbursement/cron/disbursement-processor.ts`. The error occurs because `null` is being used in a query filter where TypeScript expects `string | NestedStringFilter<"AffiliateRiseAccount"> | undefined`.

### The Problem

Looking at line 213:

```typescript
riseId: { not: null },
```

The issue is that `null` is not assignable to the expected type. Prisma expects `undefined` instead of `null` for this type of filter.

### The Fix

Change line 213 from:

```typescript
riseId: { not: null },
```

to:

```typescript
riseId: { not: undefined },
```

Or alternatively, you can use a more explicit Prisma filter:

```typescript
riseId: { isSet: true },
```

### Complete Updated Code (lines 210-215)

```typescript
// Get all Rise accounts that have a riseId
const accounts = await this.prisma.affiliateRiseAccount.findMany({
  where: {
    riseId: { not: undefined },
  },
});
```

This change ensures type compatibility with Prisma's expected filter types and will resolve the TypeScript compilation error.
