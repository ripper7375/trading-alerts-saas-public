The failing job is the "Production Build Check." According to the logs, the issue summary includes "- ✅ Integration Tests: success" and "- ✅ Build Check: failure." This means the build step in your workflow failed.

Examining your workflow definition, the "Build Next.js" step runs pnpm run build. The "Check bundle size" step fails if the Next.js .next/ directory exceeds 370MB:

```bash
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 370 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 370MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

To resolve the failure:

- Check for large or unused dependencies in your project (especially in node_modules or static assets).
- Optimize your Next.js build by using dynamic imports and analyzing bundle size with pnpm run analyze or a similar script.
- Remove unnecessary files from the .next/ directory before building or adjust your code to reduce the bundle's overall size.

Consider reducing your bundle below 370MB to pass the check. If your new feature requires a larger bundle, you may adjust the threshold, but this is not recommended unless necessary.
