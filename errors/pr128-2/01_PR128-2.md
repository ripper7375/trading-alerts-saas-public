The job failed because the bundle size after building Next.js exceeded the set threshold of 370MB (actual size: 375MB). To resolve this, reduce the bundle size to below 370MB. Here are concrete steps you can take:

1. Remove unused dependencies and code, especially large node modules or third-party packages.
2. Use dynamic imports to split your code and load components only when needed.
3. Optimize images and static assets in your project.
4. Consider enabling Next.js output file tracing or build optimizations (e.g., experimental.minify).
5. Check your .next/ directory for unusually large files and refactor them if necessary.

If you identify a specific dependency or asset causing the issue, try to lazy-load it or move it out of the initial bundle.

You can see the relevant workflow in the build-check job definition here:
[.github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 8f9df59cb9abf6a8db4d397a2337636c3bd36d6e)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8f9df59cb9abf6a8db4d397a2337636c3bd36d6e/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L127-L135).

Example for dynamic import in Next.js:

```js
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';
const MyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/MyComponent'));
```

After making these changes, push your updates and re-run the workflow to confirm the bundle size is under the threshold.
