The failure is due to a TypeScript error at line 47 in app/api/cron/distribute-codes/route.ts:

Property 'CRON_SECRET' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['CRON_SECRET'].

To fix this, change:

```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
```

to:

```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env['CRON_SECRET'];
```

This will resolve the type error related to environment variable access. For context, see the code here:
