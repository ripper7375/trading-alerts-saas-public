I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the job logs first. ## Solution

The build is failing due to a TypeScript error on line 47 of `app/api/cron/distribute-codes/route.ts`. TypeScript's strict index signature checking requires bracket notation to access the `CRON_SECRET` property.

### Fix

Change line 47 from:

```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env.CRON_SECRET;
```

To:

```typescript
const cronSecret = process.env['CRON_SECRET'];
```

### Complete corrected section (lines 46-47):

```typescript
const authHeader = request.headers.get('authorization');
const cronSecret = process.env['CRON_SECRET'];
```

This change satisfies TypeScript's requirement for accessing properties that come from index signatures, which is the case with `process.env`.
