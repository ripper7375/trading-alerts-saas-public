I'll analyze the failing job to identify the issue and provide a solution. ## Solution for Failing Job

The job is failing due to a **Prisma schema validation error** on line 659. The issue is with the one-to-one relationship between `DisbursementTransaction` and `Commission` models.

### Problem

```
Error parsing attribute "@relation":  A one-to-one relation must use unique fields on the defining side.
Either add an `@unique` attribute to the field `commissionId`, or change the relation to one-to-many.
```

### Fix

You need to add the `@unique` constraint to the `commissionId` field in the `DisbursementTransaction` model. Update line 658 in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

**Current code (line 658):**

```prisma
commissionId      String
```

**Fixed code:**

```prisma
commissionId      String   @unique
```

This makes sense because each commission should only have one disbursement transaction associated with it, establishing a true one-to-one relationship. The `@unique` constraint ensures that no two disbursement transactions can reference the same commission.

After making this change, run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This will resolve the Prisma validation error and allow the job to pass.
