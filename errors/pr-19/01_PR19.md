The failure is caused by a Prisma schema validation error:

> Error parsing attribute "@relation": A one-to-one relation must use unique fields on the defining side. Either add an @unique attribute to the field commissionId, or change the relation to one-to-many.

**Solution:**
In your prisma/schema.prisma file, find the model and field that uses:

```prisma
commission        Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])
```

on or near line 659.

**Code fix options:**

1. **If you intend a one-to-one relationship, add `@unique` to the `commissionId` field:**

   ```prisma
   commissionId  Int   @unique
   commission    Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])
   ```

2. **If the relationship should be one-to-many, remove `@unique` from `commissionId`:**
   ```prisma
   commissionId  Int
   commission    Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])
   ```
   And in the related model, update the relation field to return an array.

**How to choose:**

- Use **option 1** if each record should have only one related commission.
- Use **option 2** if multiple records can be related to a single commission.

**Action required:**  
Edit your prisma/schema.prisma as above and re-run your workflow.
