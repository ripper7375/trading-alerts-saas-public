I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing due to a Prisma schema validation error. Let me check the schema file to see the issue: ## Solution

The Prisma schema validation is failing because of a **one-to-one relation** constraint error on line 659 in the `DisbursementTransaction` model.

### The Problem

The `commission` field has a `@relation` directive pointing to a unique `commissionId`, but Prisma requires that in a one-to-one relationship, the field containing the foreign key must be marked as `@unique`. Currently, multiple `DisbursementTransaction` records can reference the same `Commission`, making this a one-to-many relationship from `Commission`'s perspective.

### The Fix

You have two options:

**Option 1: Make it a true one-to-one relationship** (if each commission should only have one disbursement transaction):

```prisma
model DisbursementTransaction {
  // ... other fields ...

  // Commission Reference (from Part 17)
  commissionId      String   @unique  // Add @unique here
  commission        Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])

  // ... rest of the model ...
}
```

**Option 2: Change to a one-to-many relationship** (if a commission can have multiple disbursement transactions):

In the `Commission` model (line 484), change:

```prisma
model Commission {
  // ... other fields ...

  // Part 19: Disbursement relationship
  disbursementTransaction DisbursementTransaction?  // Change to array

  // becomes:
  disbursementTransactions DisbursementTransaction[]  // plural, not optional

  // ... indexes ...
}
```

And keep `DisbursementTransaction` as is (without adding `@unique` to `commissionId`).

**Recommended approach**: Option 2 seems more appropriate for a disbursement system, as you may need to track multiple disbursement attempts or transactions for a single commission (retries, refunds, etc.).
