I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me start by getting the job logs. ## Solution

The Prisma schema validation is failing because of an incorrectly defined one-to-one relationship in the `DisbursementTransaction` model.

**The Problem:**

At line 659, the `commission` field has a `@relation` attribute that references `commissionId`, but for a one-to-one relationship, the field must be marked as `@unique`. Currently, multiple `DisbursementTransaction` records could reference the same `Commission`, making it a one-to-many relationship.

**The Fix:**

You need to add `@unique` to the `commissionId` field on line 658. Change:

```prisma
// Commission Reference (from Part 17)
commissionId      String
commission        Commission @relation(fields:  [commissionId], references: [id])
```

To:

```prisma
// Commission Reference (from Part 17)
commissionId      String   @unique
commission        Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])
```

**Alternative Solution:**

If you actually want multiple disbursement transactions to be able to reference the same commission (one-to-many), then you need to change the `Commission` model (line 484) to allow multiple disbursements:

```prisma
// Change from:
disbursementTransaction DisbursementTransaction?

// To:
disbursementTransactions DisbursementTransaction[]
```

Based on your schema structure, the second option (one-to-many) seems more appropriate, as a commission might have multiple disbursement attempts or transactions. Apply this change to allow multiple disbursement transactions per commission.
