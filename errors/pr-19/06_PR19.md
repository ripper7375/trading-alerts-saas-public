I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me first get the logs to see what's causing the failure. ## Solution

The Prisma schema validation is failing because of an incorrect one-to-one relation definition on line 659. The error indicates that a one-to-one relation must use unique fields on the defining side.

**Problem:**
The `DisbursementTransaction` model has a `@relation` to `Commission` using `commissionId`, but `commissionId` is not marked as `@unique`. This creates ambiguity - Prisma doesn't know if this should be a one-to-one or one-to-many relationship.

**Solution:**

You need to add the `@unique` constraint to the `commissionId` field on line 658 in `prisma/schema.prisma`:

```prisma
model DisbursementTransaction {
  id                String   @id @default(cuid())

  // Batch Reference
  batchId           String
  batch             PaymentBatch @relation(fields: [batchId], references: [id])

  // Commission Reference (from Part 17)
  commissionId      String   @unique  // <-- Add @unique here
  commission        Commission @relation(fields: [commissionId], references: [id])

  // ... rest of the model
}
```

This makes it clear that each `DisbursementTransaction` is linked to exactly one `Commission`, and each `Commission` can have at most one `DisbursementTransaction`, establishing a proper one-to-one relationship.

After making this change, the Prisma schema validation will pass and your CI job should succeed.
