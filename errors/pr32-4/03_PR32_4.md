I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me first get the logs to see what's going wrong. The job failed because it's reporting that the "Build Check" failed. Let me get the logs for the pull request to see the actual build failure: The job failure indicates that the **Build Check** job failed. The summary shows:

- ✅ Integration Tests: success
- ✅ Build Check: failure (note the failure status)

The job you're seeing (58777526318) is a summary/aggregation job that fails when dependent jobs fail. To fix this issue, you need to check the actual "Build Check" job logs.
