The failing job’s error is a bundle size check: your build output is 307MB, which exceeds the allowed threshold of 300MB.

### Solution

To resolve this, you need to reduce the build bundle size below 300MB. Here are targeted suggestions:

1. **Analyze Bundle Composition**
   - Use a tool like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` or similar to visualize and identify large dependencies or code splits.
   - Run:
     ```bash
     npx webpack-bundle-analyzer ./path/to/stats.json
     ```

2. **Remove Unused Dependencies**
   - Audit your dependencies in `package.json`; remove any you don’t use.
   - Use tools like `depcheck` to help:
     ```bash
     npx depcheck
     ```

3. **Optimize Imports**
   - Replace full library imports with specific component imports (e.g., import only needed parts from UI/framework libraries).
   - Example:

     ```js
     // Instead of:
     import _ from 'lodash';

     // Use:
     import debounce from 'lodash/debounce';
     ```

4. **Code Splitting & Dynamic Imports**
   - Utilize dynamic imports to split code that’s not needed at initial load.

5. **Enable Production Optimizations**
   - Make sure your build is running in `production` mode for minification, tree-shaking, etc.

6. **Check Output Directory**
   - Sometimes unnecessary files (source maps, unused assets) are included in the bundle—ensure only necessary files are output.

### Example: If using Webpack, in `webpack.config.js`:

```js
optimization: {
  splitChunks: {
    chunks: 'all',
  },
},
mode: 'production',
```

### If you want to see file contents or configs referenced in this job (`.github/workflows/tests.yml`, build config), let me know!

Once implemented, commit your optimizations and re-run the workflow to confirm the bundle is below 300MB.
