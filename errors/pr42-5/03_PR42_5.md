The job failed because at least one of the dependent jobs did not pass, triggering the final "Test Summary" step to exit with code 1.

To address this:

1. Check the results of unit, integration, and build jobs—review the logs for Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, and Production Build Check jobs to identify specific failures.
2. Fix the root cause in the failing job. For example, if eslint or type-check failed, run pnpm run lint or pnpm run type-check locally and address errors.
3. If you see bundle size exceeded 340MB in the build job, reduce your Next.js build output below the threshold in .github/workflows/tests.yml (see the build size check at lines 126–135 in the workflow).

Example code fix for a linter failure:

```sh
pnpm run lint --fix
```

After fixing errors in your local environment, commit and push the changes to rerun the GitHub Actions CI.

For direct reference, see the test workflow file: .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: e658480707057c52b3ddcea1dd1bd03502dc7cfc).
