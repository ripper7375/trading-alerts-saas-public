The failure in job 58966890754 is caused by the test-summary job failing when one or more of the previous jobs did not succeed. According to your workflow file (.github/workflows/tests.yml at ref 0345e057d0c6d40f9d39f101bcf9f9e18b97b30e), the relevant step is:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
    needs.build-check.result != 'success'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

Additionally, the job log confirms that integration tests and build checks were skipped, likely because the jobs they depend on (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) did not run or were filtered out due to workflow conditions.

**Solution:**

- Ensure that all required jobs are correctly triggered and not skipped due to branch filters or conditions.
- Check that the "unit-and-component-tests," "integration-tests," and "build-check" jobs run and pass, as the test-summary job depends on their success.
- If you intend to skip jobs under some conditions (for example, for documentation-only PRs), consider modifying the test-summary job to avoid failing if jobs are intentionally skipped. For example, change the condition to check for 'skipped' as well:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Or handle 'skipped' results more gracefully, depending on your workflow needs.

Review the triggers and logic for skipping jobs and adjust so the test-summary job reflects your intended workflow outcome.
