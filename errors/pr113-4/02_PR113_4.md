The failing job (59048913704) is the "Test Summary" job, which aggregates results from other jobs. According to the logs, this job failed because the "Build Check" job failed.

From the workflow definition (.github/workflows/tests.yml), the "Build Check" job runs a production build and checks that the Next.js bundle size does not exceed 360MB:

```sh
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 360 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 360MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

To fix this:

- Reduce the size of your Next.js bundle so it fits under 360MB. You can do this by:
  - Removing unused dependencies and dead code.
  - Using code splitting and dynamic imports for large dependencies.
  - Optimizing images and other static assets.
  - Ensuring you are not including large server-only or development modules in the client bundle.

If you need a temporary workaround to unblock the build, you could increase the threshold in the workflow file, but this is not recommended as a long-term solution.

Review your recent changes for anything that might have increased the bundle size and optimize accordingly. You can view and modify the size check in the workflow here:
