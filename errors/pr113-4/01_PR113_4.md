The job failed because the production Next.js build's bundle size is 361MB, exceeding the configured threshold of 360MB in your workflow. The relevant check is in the build-check job’s "Check bundle size" step:

```sh
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 360 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 360MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

See the job: .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: dc9506c03a56a2fe36b7a4cdfafc83a386ca2b38)

**Solution options:**

1. Reduce the bundle size below 360MB. Suggestions:
   - Remove unused dependencies.
   - Optimize images/assets.
   - Use dynamic imports for large/rarely used modules.
   - Analyze the build with `pnpm run analyze` (if available) to spot bloat.
2. If the increased size is intentional and justified for this release, increase the threshold in your workflow:
   ```yaml
   # Change this in the workflow:
   if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 360 ]; then
   # For example, to:
   if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 370 ]; then
   ```
   Adjust the value based on your team's standards.

Choose the approach that fits your project's needs—optimizing is preferred, but raising the threshold is a quick fix if appropriate.
