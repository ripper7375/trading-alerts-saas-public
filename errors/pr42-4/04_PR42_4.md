The job failed because the code is trying to access prisma.systemConfig and prisma.systemConfigHistory on the PrismaClient instance, but those models do not exist in your Prisma schema. The TypeScript errors are clear (TS2339: Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient') and appear in these files and lines:

- app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts: lines 86, 290, 302, 319
- app/api/config/affiliate/route.ts: line 54
- lib/affiliate/constants.ts: line 125

**How to fix:**  
You need to add the missing models to your Prisma schema (prisma/schema.prisma) and migrate your database. Based on usage (see [route.ts (ref)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/bc0245cf0bf5f9deb4e323483176672a6d4df0c0/app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts)), the expected models are:

```prisma
model SystemConfig {
  key        String   @id
  value      String
  valueType  String?
  category   String?
  description String?
  updatedBy  String?
  updatedAt  DateTime @updatedAt
}

model SystemConfigHistory {
  id         Int      @id @default(autoincrement())
  configKey  String
  oldValue   String
  newValue   String
  changedBy  String
  reason     String?
  changedAt  DateTime @default(now())
}
```

**Next Steps:**

1. Update `prisma/schema.prisma` with the above models.
2. Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-system-config` to generate and apply the migration.
3. Retry your workflow.

This will resolve the TypeScript errors and allow Prisma to generate the required client properties.
