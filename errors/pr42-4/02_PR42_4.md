The failing job is caused by the following error in app/api/admin/settings/affiliate/route.ts line 86:

Property 'systemConfig' does not exist on type 'PrismaClient'.

Solution:
Make sure the Prisma schema defines a model named SystemConfig, and the generated Prisma client includes a property systemConfig. If your schema uses a different name or has a lowercase table name, update all occurrences of prisma.systemConfig to match the actual property name.

For example, if your model is named system_config, the generated client property may be prisma.system_config or prisma.systemConfig depending on Prisma's naming rules. Check your Prisma schema file (schema.prisma) and generated client.

Code suggestion:
If your Prisma schema uses SystemConfig:
No change needed to model usage; check for typing issues or recent changes to schema/prisma client.

If it's system_config, update your code like this (wherever prisma.systemConfig appears):

```typescript
// Before
const configs = await prisma.systemConfig.findMany({
  /* ... */
});

// After (if model is system_config)
const configs = await prisma.system_config.findMany({
  /* ... */
});
```

Apply this update to all systemConfig usages in the route.ts file, including the GET handler and updateConfig function.
