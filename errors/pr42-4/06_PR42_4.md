The failing job 58852473091 corresponds to the "Test Summary" job in your workflow. The logs show the summary step marks the Integration Tests and Build Check as "skipped", and then this step fails with the message: "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and exits with code 1.

Based on your .github/workflows/tests.yml, this summary job depends on the results of the "unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", and "build-check" jobs. If any of these jobs is skipped or fails, the summary job will exit with failure.

The root problem is that the "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" jobs were skipped, most likely because their prerequisite jobs were not run or were filtered out by the workflow triggers or conditions. When required jobs are skipped, their result is not 'success', causing this downstream failure.

Solution:
Ensure that the prerequisite jobs are always run for your workflow, especially during pull requests. Double-check your trigger conditions under on: and the matrix/needs configuration to confirm that jobs like "unit-and-component-tests" are executed so "integration-tests" and "build-check" aren’t skipped.

If you want the summary job to only run when all required jobs have actually executed, you can add checks to ensure jobs were run (not skipped) before evaluating their result, or adjust workflow triggers/paths so all jobs always execute as expected.
