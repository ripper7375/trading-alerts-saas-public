The failure in job 59020239034 occurred because one or more test jobs failed in earlier steps. According to the logs and job definition in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 83294c3b4e872a10c8c4e5c3d83776ad29a03825), the test-summary job checks the result of unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check jobs. If any of these fail, it triggers a failure with "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and exits with code 1.

To fix this issue:

1. Review the results and logs for the following jobs:
   - unit-and-component-tests
   - integration-tests
   - build-check

2. Identify which job failed (since test-summary only reports an aggregate result).

3. Resolve the underlying failure in that specific job. Common issues include:
   - Failing tests in your codebase.
   - Lint or type errors.
   - Build size exceeding 360MB (in build-check).

4. After fixing the specific errors, push changes to trigger a new run.

If you need further help, provide logs or error messages from the failing job for targeted advice.
