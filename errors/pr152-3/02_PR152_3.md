The failing job occurred because TypeScript reported the following error in app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts (line 73):

Property 'twoFactorEnabled' does not exist on type 'User'.

To solve this:

1. Ensure that the twoFactorEnabled field exists in your User model (e.g., in your Prisma schema). If it does not, add it:

```prisma
model User {
  // ... other fields ...
  twoFactorEnabled Boolean @default(false)
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

2. If the field exists in the database but not in the TypeScript types, re-generate your Prisma client by running:

```
npx prisma generate
```

3. Make sure any type definitions used for User in TypeScript include twoFactorEnabled (for example, check your types in node_modules or custom types if you override them).

After making these changes, re-run your workflow to confirm the issue is resolved.
