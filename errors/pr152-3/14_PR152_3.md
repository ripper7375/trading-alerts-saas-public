The job is failing because the code tries to access properties (twoFactorEnabled, twoFactorSecret, twoFactorBackupCodes, twoFactorVerifiedAt) on the User type, but TypeScript cannot find them. This usually indicates that your Prisma schema and your generated Prisma Client are out of sync.

**Solution:**

1. Your prisma/schema.prisma has the following fields on User:
   - twoFactorEnabled (Boolean)
   - twoFactorSecret (String?)
   - twoFactorBackupCodes (String?)
   - twoFactorVerifiedAt (DateTime?)

2. Your code correctly references these fields in multiple files, for example:
   - [app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b/app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts#L64)
   - [app/api/user/2fa/disable/route.ts](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b/app/api/user/2fa/disable/route.ts#L68)
   - [app/api/user/2fa/setup/route.ts](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b/app/api/user/2fa/setup/route.ts#L42)
   - [lib/auth/auth-options.ts](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b/lib/auth/auth-options.ts#L225)

3. **You need to regenerate your Prisma Client** after adding these fields to your schema.

**To fix:**

1. Run the following commands in your project root:

   ```sh
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   (Or use `pnpm prisma generate` or `yarn prisma generate` as appropriate.)

2. Commit the update if you check in generated files:

   ```sh
   git add node_modules/.prisma client/
   git commit -m "Regenerate Prisma Client for new User 2FA fields"
   ```

3. Restart any running dev/build processes.

**If the error persists:**  
Double-check that:

- The migration for these fields was run, and the database is up to date.
- You are importing the correct instance of the generated Prisma Client.

This should resolve all `TS2339: Property 'twoFactor<...>' does not exist on type 'User'.` errors.
