The failing job 59235134403 is from the "Test Summary" job in your workflow. The job fails with the message "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and exits with code 1. This job aggregates the results of "unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", and "build-check". The failure indicates that at least one of these dependent jobs did not succeed.

Solution:

1. Review the actual results for unit, integration, and build jobs. The summary job fails if any of these return 'failure'.
2. To resolve this, ensure the following:
   - All test jobs ("Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", "Production Build Check") pass in the workflow.
   - If jobs are being skipped (as seen in the logs with "skipped" summary lines), check any conditionals or matrix settings that would bypass critical steps. Make sure jobs are not conditionally skipped due to previous failures or misconfigurations.
   - If using the summary (needs.\*.result), validate that jobs return 'success' and not 'skipped', as a skipped job may be interpreted as failure.

Code suggestion:
If you intend for skipped jobs not to cause the "Test Summary" to fail, adjust the conditional in the "Fail if any test failed" step:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

You may want to explicitly allow 'skipped' to pass:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  # optionally account for 'skipped' state if that is acceptable
```

Otherwise, investigate why any upstream job was skipped or failed, and address the underlying test or build issue. Review each relevant script or test output to fix the root error.
