The failure is caused by a TypeScript error in app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts at line 73:

Property 'twoFactorEnabled' does not exist on type 'User'.

Solution:
Update your Prisma schema and/or TypeScript types to ensure that the User type includes the twoFactorEnabled property. This property is selected in your prisma.user.findUnique call (line 64), so make sure your Prisma model (and its generated types) includes twoFactorEnabled:boolean.

If it does, but TypeScript still complains, regenerate Prisma types by running:

npx prisma generate

If the property is new or missing, add it to your Prisma schema user model, then run:

npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma generate

and confirm that type User includes twoFactorEnabled.

Summary code fix:
Ensure your schema.prisma user model contains:

```prisma
model User {
  id                String   @id @default(uuid())
  email             String   @unique
  password          String
  twoFactorEnabled  Boolean  @default(false)
  // ... other fields ...
}
```

Then regenerate your schema and types. This will resolve the TypeScript error found in your job log.
