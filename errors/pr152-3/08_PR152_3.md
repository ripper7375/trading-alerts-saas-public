The failure is due to the "TypeScript type check" step in your workflow. The logs show:

❌ Type check: FAILED

This comes from the "type-check" job, which runs pnpm run type-check (see .github/workflows/security-checks.yml, lines 65-69). The relevant script is likely defined in your package.json and should run tsc or similar.

Solution:

1. Run pnpm run type-check locally to see the specific TypeScript errors.
2. Review and fix all type errors shown in the output. This could involve correcting type mismatches, importing correct types, or resolving undefined variables in your TypeScript files.
3. Once you fix the errors, commit and push your changes. The job should pass.

Common issues to look for:

- Missing type annotations.
- Incorrect or missing imports.
- Usage of types/interfaces not defined or imported.

If you are unsure about a specific error, share the local type-check output for exact code suggestions.
