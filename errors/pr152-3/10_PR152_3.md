The build failed because the TypeScript code is trying to access User properties like twoFactorEnabled, twoFactorSecret, twoFactorBackupCodes, and twoFactorVerifiedAt which TypeScript doesn't think exist on the User type. However, both your Prisma schema (User model, lines 123–126 in schema.prisma) and the TypeScript User interface (lines 25–28 in types/user.ts) do define these fields.

The likely problem is a mismatch between your Prisma schema and the generated Prisma Client types or a stale TypeScript type import. Here's how to fix the issue:

**Solution Steps**

1. Update Prisma Client types to match your schema:

   ```sh
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   This ensures all new User model fields are included in the generated Prisma Client types.

2. Ensure you're using the correct User type in your API code. If you are importing User from the Prisma Client, make sure it is regenerated as above. If you're using a custom type (like types/user.ts), verify that it's up to date with the schema.

3. If you get type errors when accessing User fields, and the `User` interface in `types/user.ts` is used, ensure it exports all relevant 2FA properties:

   ```typescript
   export interface User {
     // ...other fields
     twoFactorEnabled: boolean;
     twoFactorSecret: string | null;
     twoFactorBackupCodes: string | null;
     twoFactorVerifiedAt: Date | null;
   }
   ```

   See full type here: types/user.ts (ref: f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b)

4. After regenerating types and/or updating interfaces, restart your TypeScript server and rerun your build.

**Summary**

- Run `npx prisma generate` to update types from your current schema.
- Ensure all project code references the correct and up-to-date User type.
- If your User type is duplicated (custom vs. Prisma-generated), consolidate them to eliminate conflicts.

This will resolve the TS2339 errors for properties not existing on User and fix your build.
