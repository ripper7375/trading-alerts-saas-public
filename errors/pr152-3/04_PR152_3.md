The failing job is due to a TypeScript error in app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts: Property 'twoFactorEnabled' does not exist on type 'User'. This typically means the User type used by prisma.user.findUnique() in your POST handler (lines 58–66) does not include twoFactorEnabled.

Solution:
Update the User type definition (usually defined by your Prisma schema) to ensure that it includes the twoFactorEnabled property. If you’re using Prisma and the field exists in your database, run npx prisma generate to refresh typings.

Alternatively, if the field isn’t present in your database, you must add it to your Prisma schema and apply the migration.

Example fix (if the field exists in your database, or after migration):
No code change in this file is needed; the compile error will resolve after regenerating types:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

If you want to avoid the type error as a workaround and confirm twoFactorEnabled is available at runtime, you can use a type assertion:

```typescript
// Replace this line:
if (!user.twoFactorEnabled) {

// With this workaround:
if (!(user as any).twoFactorEnabled) {
```

However, the type-safe and recommended fix is to update your User type.

For reference, you can find the failing code in your repository here (branch ref: f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b):
app/api/user/2fa/backup-codes/route.ts

Summary: Regenerate your Prisma types so User includes twoFactorEnabled, or update your schema and migrate if it does not exist in the database.
