The failing job is caused by TypeScript errors indicating that properties like twoFactorEnabled, twoFactorSecret, twoFactorBackupCodes, and twoFactorVerifiedAt do not exist on the User type returned from Prisma in your 2FA-related API routes.

Solution:

Your Prisma User model (see prisma/schema.prisma, ref: f92a947743e285ca21be25dabc57a2ec90a0b65b) defines these properties:

```
twoFactorEnabled     Boolean  @default(false)
twoFactorSecret      String?  // Encrypted TOTP secret
twoFactorBackupCodes String?  // JSON array of hashed backup codes
twoFactorVerifiedAt  DateTime? // When 2FA was successfully enabled
```

However, in your API route file queries, you are correctly selecting these fields, so the issue likely comes from the generated Prisma types or an outdated schema.

**Code Suggestion:**

1. Run the following in your project root to regenerate Prisma Client so the latest type definitions are picked up:
   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```
2. Make sure your codebase is referencing the generated types (and not an outdated or custom type definition).

3. If you have a custom User type defined elsewhere (such as types/User.ts) that does not include these properties, update it to match the Prisma schema:
   ```typescript
   export interface User {
     id: string;
     email: string;
     name?: string;
     password?: string;
     // ...
     twoFactorEnabled: boolean;
     twoFactorSecret?: string;
     twoFactorBackupCodes?: string;
     twoFactorVerifiedAt?: Date;
   }
   ```
   Ensure this interface reflects the actual Prisma model, or better yet, use the types generated by Prisma Client directly.

**Summary:**  
Regenerate your Prisma Client (`npx prisma generate`) and make sure any custom User typings are consistent with the Prisma schema. This will resolve all TS2339 errors concerning missing two-factor auth properties on User and allow your build to pass.
