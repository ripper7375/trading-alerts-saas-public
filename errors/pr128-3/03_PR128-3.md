The job failed in the "Build Check" step, specifically during the production build or bundle size check. According to the workflow (.github/workflows/tests.yml, ref: fab17013c642614a70dcd4898132a5e5cee882dc), the build is marked as failed if the .next directory exceeds 370MB:

```bash
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 370 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 370MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Solution:

- Optimize your Next.js build to reduce the .next folder size. Suggestions:
  - Analyze bundle size with `pnpm run analyze` or by enabling Webpack Bundle Analyzer.
  - Remove unused dependencies, components, or assets.
  - Use dynamic imports for large or rarely used components.
  - Compress large images/assets or serve them from a CDN.
- If the large bundle size is expected from a new feature, consider raising the threshold, but this should be avoided unless necessary.

To proceed, review the bundle size locally, make optimizations, and ensure the build output remains under 370MB to pass this job.
