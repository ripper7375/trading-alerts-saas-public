The failing job occurred because the production Next.js bundle size is 375MB, which exceeds the configured limit of 370MB in your workflow. To resolve this:

- Reduce your project's bundle size to below 370MB. This can be achieved by:
  - Removing unused dependencies and code.
  - Analyzing large imports and using dynamic imports for infrequently used modules.
  - Optimizing large assets and images in the .next directory.
  - Leveraging Next.js features like image optimization and code splitting.

In your workflow (see step), the bundle size is determined and the job fails if it exceeds the threshold:

```sh
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 370 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 370MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Review your recent changes for any code or dependencies that may have caused the bundle size increase, optimize your project as needed, and rerun the workflow.
