I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The test failure is in the component test `PnLSummaryCards Component › revenue section › should display discounts label`. Let me check the test file and the component: ## Solution for Failing Test

The test is failing because the component has been updated to include the discount percentage in the label, but the test is still looking for the old label text.

**Failing Test (Line 66):**

```tsx
expect(screen.getByText('Discounts Given')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

**Actual Component Output (Line 44):**

```tsx
{ label: `Discounts Given (${discountPercent}%)`, value: `-${formatCurrency(discounts)}`, className: 'text-orange-600' }
```

The component now renders "Discounts Given (20%)" instead of just "Discounts Given".

### Fix

Update the test at line 64-67 in `__tests__/components/admin/pnl-summary-cards.test.tsx`:

```tsx
it('should display discounts label', () => {
  render(<PnLSummaryCards {...defaultProps} />);
  expect(screen.getByText('Discounts Given (20%)')).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

Or, if you want to make the test more flexible to handle different discount percentages:

```tsx
it('should display discounts label', () => {
  render(<PnLSummaryCards {...defaultProps} />);
  expect(screen.getByText(/Discounts Given \(\d+%\)/)).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```

This change aligns the test expectation with the updated component behavior where the discount percentage is dynamically included in the label.
