The job failed in the test-summary step because one or more prior jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) did not succeed. The summary step is configured to exit with an error if any of these jobs fail.

To resolve this, review and fix the failed or skipped jobs. According to the logs, integration and build checks were skipped. This usually means a dependency step did not complete successfully or a conditional was not met.

Suggestions:

1. Ensure that the unit-and-component-tests job completes successfully. Check for failures or configuration issues in your test scripts.
2. Avoid skipping integration-tests and build-check jobs by confirming that the previous jobs (“needs”) finish with status success. Ensure these jobs are not being skipped due to conditional logic or dependency failures.
3. If you want the workflow to pass even if some tests are skipped (such as for pull requests where integration tests aren’t relevant), modify the jobs’ "if" conditions to explicitly allow this, or make the test-summary job not fail when jobs are skipped:

In .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: 759ff2b7a5d8a142f3129f6a558c1cf019597a54), replace:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result != 'success' ||
  needs.build-check.result != 'success'
run: |
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
```

with

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
run: |
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
```

This way, the summary step will only fail if a job actually failed, not if it was skipped.

Review skipped and failed jobs for more details and address any dependency or configuration issues to ensure all required jobs run to completion.
