The failing job was caused by a dependency version mismatch: the lockfile specifies newman@^6.2.0, but package.json specifies newman@^6.2.1. This triggers an install error because your workflow uses pnpm with --frozen-lockfile.

**Solution:**  
Make sure the newman version in package.json matches the one in package-lock.json. Here’s how you can fix it:

1. Open your root package.json and ensure the version for newman is ^6.2.1:
   ```json
   "devDependencies": {
     "newman": "^6.2.1",
     ...
   }
   ```
2. Delete node_modules and the lockfile:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json pnpm-lock.yaml
   ```
3. Reinstall with your preferred package manager (pnpm, npm, or yarn) to regenerate the lockfile:
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
4. Commit the updated lockfile.

This will resolve the dependency mismatch error noted in the job logs.
