The job failed due to a mismatch between the dependency version for newman in your package.json and package-lock.json files:

- package.json: "newman": "^6.2.1"
- package-lock.json: "newman": "^6.2.0"

**Solution:**
To resolve this, update your lockfile to match package.json:

1. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   This will update package-lock.json to reflect the "^6.2.1" specifier from package.json.

2. Commit the updated package-lock.json file to your repository.

**Summary:**  
The root cause is an out-of-date lockfile. Make sure to always run npm install after modifying dependency versions in package.json to keep the lockfile in sync.
