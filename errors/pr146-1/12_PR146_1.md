The job failed because the version of the newman dependency in package.json (^6.2.1) does not match the version in the lockfile (^6.2.0).

Solution:

1. Run npm install to update the lockfile (package-lock.json or equivalent) so it matches the newman version in package.json.
2. Commit the updated lockfile.

If you intended to use newman@^6.2.0, change package.json to match the lockfile instead, then run npm install and commit both files.

Example commands:

```sh
# If you want to keep ^6.2.1 in package.json
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: update lockfile to match newman version ^6.2.1"
```

or

```sh
# If you want to downgrade to ^6.2.0 in package.json
npm install newman@^6.2.0 --save-dev
git add package.json package-lock.json
git commit -m "chore: sync newman version to ^6.2.0"
```

Choose the option matching your desired dependency version. This will resolve the mismatch and the failing job.
