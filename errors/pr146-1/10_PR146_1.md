The failing job is caused by a dependency mismatch between package.json and package-lock.json for the newman package:

- package.json specifies: "newman": "^6.2.1"
- package-lock.json (lockfile) has: "newman": "^6.2.0"

**Solution:**  
Update your lockfile to match package.json. Run the following command in your project root:

```bash
pnpm install
```

or if you use npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will update the lockfile, resolving the version mismatch for newman. Commit the updated package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml) to your branch.

Additionally, the test/coverage job is failing because no coverage report is produced (coverage/lcov.info not found). Ensure your tests generate a coverage report by running the correct test script before the upload step. You can generate coverage by running:

```bash
pnpm run test:coverage
```

or

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

Review your CI workflow (.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml) and confirm that your test and coverage generation steps create the coverage/lcov.info file as expected.

Summary of required changes:

1. Regenerate your lockfile and commit the result to resolve the dependency mismatch.
2. Make sure your test scripts produce the required coverage reports for CI.
