The job failed due to a version mismatch between the specifier for the `newman` dependency in your `package-lock.json` (showing `^6.2.0`) and your `package.json` (showing `^6.2.1`). To resolve this, ensure both files specify the same version.

**Solution:**

1. Update your lockfile to match the version in your `package.json`:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   This will synchronize the versions and update the lockfile.

2. Commit the updated `package-lock.json` alongside your changes:
   ```sh
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Sync package-lock.json with package.json for newman"
   ```

For reference:

- Your `package.json` (`newman`: `^6.2.1`): [View package.json](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/31e29c76d20ad560c763f76f1f96b22691195bfd/package.json)
- Your `package-lock.json` (`newman`: `^6.2.0`): [View package-lock.json](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/31e29c76d20ad560c763f76f1f96b22691195bfd/package-lock.json)

**Summary:**  
Run `npm install` and commit the result to resolve the CI lockfile-dependency mismatch.
