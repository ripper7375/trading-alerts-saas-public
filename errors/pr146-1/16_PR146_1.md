The failing job occurred because the lockfile and package.json specify different versions for the newman dependency:

- In package.json (line 142): "newman": "^6.2.1"
- In package-lock.json: "newman": "^6.2.0"

**Solution:**  
To fix this, update your lockfile so its specifiers match package.json:

1. Run the following command to refresh the lockfile:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

   or, if you’re using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml) and push it to your branch.

This will synchronize the dependency versions and resolve the failed check.
