The failing job is due to a dependency version mismatch between package.json and your lockfile:

- newman (lockfile: ^6.2.0, manifest: ^6.2.1)

Solution:

1. Run the following command in your project directory to sync the lockfile with package.json:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
   or, if you use yarn:
   ```sh
   yarn install
   ```
2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).

This will resolve the version mismatch and fix the job failure.
