The logs show that the job failed due to the summary step reporting "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and exiting with code 1. This happens in the test-summary job when one of unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check fails ([see .github/workflows/tests.yml, lines 170-176](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/31e29c76d20ad560c763f76f1f96b22691195bfd/.github/workflows/tests.yml)).

Solution:

- Review the logs for unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check to identify which specific job failed and why.
- Once you find the failing job’s error (e.g., test failure, build error, linter issue, bundle size exceeded), fix the cause directly in the codebase or configuration.
- After fixing the issue, push your changes and rerun the workflow.

If the summary is reporting failure but the detailed jobs show as “skipped,” make sure those prerequisite jobs are properly defined and not conditionally excluded or misconfigured.

If you share logs from those jobs, I can suggest a precise code fix.
