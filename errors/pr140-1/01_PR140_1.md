The main issue causing the job failure is:

**CRON_SECRET not configured**  
Your logs show the following errors from app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts:

```
console.error('CRON_SECRET not configured');
return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Cron job not configured' }, { status: 500 });
```

This means your job is expecting the environment variable CRON_SECRET, but it is not set in your CI environment.

## Solution

1. **Set CRON_SECRET in your CI/CD secrets or environment variables.**
   - In GitHub Actions, go to your repository → Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret.
   - Name it `CRON_SECRET` and set the value to your private cron secret string.
   - In your workflow YAML (`.github/workflows/ci-nextjs-progressive.yml`), ensure it is available to the job:
     ```yaml
     env:
       CRON_SECRET: ${{ secrets.CRON_SECRET }}
     ```

2. **If your local `.env` file or test configuration relies on mock values, ensure you add a default for test environments:**
   ```env
   # .env.test or process.env setup file
   CRON_SECRET=test-secret
   ```

**Summary:**  
Set CRON_SECRET in your CI env variables and (optionally) mock its value for local/test runs to fix this CI job failure.
