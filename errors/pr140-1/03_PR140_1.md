The failure occurred in the Test Summary job. According to the workflow definition, this job fails if any of the previous jobs—unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check—failed. The logs show both "Integration Tests: skipped" and "Build Check: skipped." This usually means one of the jobs (likely unit-and-component-tests or integration-tests) was skipped or failed, causing downstream jobs not to run.

Solutions:

1. Check conditions for job skipping:
   - Ensure that the jobs listed under needs are actually being triggered and not skipped. Double-check branch settings in the workflow on lines 4–7 to confirm your PR branch matches.

2. Fix the summary logic to accurately reflect skipped/failed states:
   - Update the summary display in test-summary to differentiate between skipped and failed jobs.

3. If jobs are skipped due to matrix/build conditions:
   - Ensure job requirements (like installing dependencies or generating artifacts in prior jobs) are met for each PR.

Example code change (for better summary detection):

Replace:

```yaml
echo "- ✅ Integration Tests: ${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```

With:

```yaml
if [[ "${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" == "skipped" ]]; then
  echo "- ⚠️ Integration Tests: Skipped" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
else
  echo "- ✅ Integration Tests: ${{ needs.integration-tests.result }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
fi
```

If the jobs should not be skipped, verify your branch and PR targets align with the patterns on lines 5 and 7 in the workflow.
