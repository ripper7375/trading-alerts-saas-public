The job failed at the "Test Summary" step, which checks the results of previous jobs (unit-and-component tests, integration tests, build check) and will run exit 1 if any of them failed. However, the logs say both "Integration Tests: skipped" and "Build Check: skipped," which means the dependent jobs likely did not run—usually because an earlier required job (like "unit-and-component-tests") did not complete successfully or was skipped.

Solution:

1. Make sure that all previous jobs ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", and "build-check") are actually running. Review why these jobs are being skipped—this might be due to workflow conditions, filter patterns, or a misconfiguration.
2. Verify that the workflow triggers include the branch you are using. For this workflow, only pull requests to main or develop, or pushes to main, develop, or claude/\*\* branches, will run the tests.
3. If your PR does not target one of these branches, update your workflow (in .github/workflows/tests.yml) to include your branch under the branches list:
   ```yaml
   on:
     pull_request:
       branches: [main, develop, your-feature-branch]
   ```
   Replace "your-feature-branch" with your actual branch name.
4. If the jobs are intentionally skipped for certain PRs, ensure this matches your intended behavior.

Once the required jobs run, the summary step will not fail due to missing/skipped jobs. If you continue to see failed statuses for specific jobs, check their logs directly for errors in dependencies, code, or test setup.
