The failure is due to a TypeScript error in lib/auth/auth-options.ts at line 21. The createUser function has its parameter data implicitly typed as any. To fix this, explicitly type the data parameter as AdapterUser or the appropriate interface expected by your adapter.

Update this code:

```typescript
createUser: async (data) => {
```

to:

```typescript
createUser: async (data: AdapterUser) => {
```

Or, if AdapterUser is not suitable, use the correct type for the data argument as required by your Prisma schema and NextAuth adapter.

You can see the problem code here: [lib/auth/auth-options.ts#L21](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/df4e155a02e10d7841a623d9c960e1856a5e074f/lib/auth/auth-options.ts#L21).

Adding the correct type will resolve the "Parameter 'data' implicitly has an 'any' type" error and allow your build to succeed.
