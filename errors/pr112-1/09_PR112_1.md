The job failed due to a TypeScript error in lib/auth/auth-options.ts at line 21: Parameter 'data' implicitly has an 'any' type. To resolve this, explicitly type the data parameter in the createUser function of CustomPrismaAdapter. Replace:

```typescript
createUser: async (data) => {
```

with:

```typescript
createUser: async (data: AdapterUser) => {
```

This change ensures TypeScript knows the type of data and will fix the TS7006 error. See the relevant code at this link: lib/auth/auth-options.ts (ref: df4e155a02e10d7841a623d9c960e1856a5e074f).
