The failure is caused by a TypeScript error in lib/auth/auth-options.ts at line 21: Parameter 'data' implicitly has an 'any' type. To resolve this, explicitly type the data parameter in the createUser method. You can use the AdapterUser type from next-auth/adapters as a base, or the type expected by Prisma for user creation.

Replace:

```typescript
createUser: async (data) => {
```

With:

```typescript
createUser: async (data: any) => {
```

Or, for stronger typing (recommended, if known):

```typescript
import type { Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
// ...
createUser: async (data: Prisma.UserCreateInput) => {
```

This change should fix the TS7006 error. See the code in context here: lib/auth/auth-options.ts (ref df4e155a02e10d7841a623d9c960e1856a5e074f).
