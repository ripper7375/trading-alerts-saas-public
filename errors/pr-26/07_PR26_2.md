I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. ## Solution

The TypeScript error on **line 109** indicates that `commissionType` doesn't exist on the commission object returned from the database query. The issue is that the `commissions` query (lines 55-62) doesn't explicitly include the `commissionType` field in the selection.

### Fix

Update the `commissions` include on **line 55** to explicitly select the `commissionType` field:

```typescript
commissions: {
  where: {
    status: 'APPROVED',
    disbursementTransaction:  null,
  },
  select: {
    id: true,
    commissionAmount: true,
    commissionType: true,
    createdAt: true,
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt:  'desc' },
  take: 100,
},
```

Alternatively, if you want to keep all fields without specifying them individually, ensure that your Prisma schema includes `commissionType` in the `Commission` model, and the query will automatically include it. However, explicitly selecting the fields you need (as shown above) is more type-safe and efficient.

This will ensure TypeScript recognizes that `commissionType` is available on the commission objects when you map them on line 109.
