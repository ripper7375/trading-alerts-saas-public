I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me first get the logs for job 58684657471.The job is failing because one or more of its dependent test jobs failed. Let me check the full workflow run to identify which specific test job(s) are failing:The job is failing because it's detecting that one or more upstream test jobs failed. This is a summary job that aggregates the results of other test jobs in the workflow.

To identify the root cause, you need to check which specific test job(s) failed. Looking at the logs, the job shows:

- ✅ Integration Tests: skipped
- ✅ Build Check: skipped

Since these jobs were skipped rather than passing, the summary job is treating this as a failure condition.

## Solution

The workflow logic needs to be adjusted to handle skipped jobs properly. The issue is in the `.github/workflows/tests.yml` file. The summary job is likely using `if: failure()` or checking `needs.*. result` without accounting for skipped jobs.

You should modify the workflow to:

1. **Allow skipped jobs to be treated as success** in the summary job condition:

```yaml
summary:
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [unit-tests, integration-tests, build-check]
  if: always()
  steps:
    - name: Check test results
      run: |
        if [[ "${{ needs.unit-tests.result }}" == "failure" ]] || \
           [[ "${{ needs. integration-tests.result }}" == "failure" ]] || \
           [[ "${{ needs.build-check.result }}" == "failure" ]]; then
          echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
          exit 1
        else
          echo "✅ All test jobs passed or were skipped"
        fi
```

This change treats `skipped` and `success` results as acceptable, only failing when a job explicitly fails.
