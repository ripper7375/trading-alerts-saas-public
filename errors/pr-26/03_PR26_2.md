I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. Let me examine the failing file to understand the issue: ## Solution

The build is failing because the code is trying to access `c.commissionType` on line 109, but this property doesn't exist in the database schema for the commission object.

**The Issue:**
Line 109 attempts to map `commissionType`:

```typescript
type: c.commissionType,
```

However, the TypeScript error indicates that `commissionType` is not a property on the commission object returned from the database query.

**Fix:**

You need to either:

1. **Remove the `type` field** if it's not needed in the response:

```typescript
pendingCommissions: profile.commissions.map((c) => ({
  id: c.id,
  amount: Number(c.commissionAmount),
  createdAt: c.createdAt,
})),
```

2. **Add `commissionType` to the Prisma include/select** if the field exists in your schema but isn't being selected:

```typescript
commissions: {
  where: {
    status: 'APPROVED',
    disbursementTransaction: null,
  },
  select: {
    id: true,
    commissionAmount: true,
    commissionType: true,  // Add this if it exists in schema
    createdAt: true,
  },
  orderBy: { createdAt:  'desc' },
  take: 100,
},
```

3. **Add the field to your Prisma schema** if it doesn't exist and you need it:

Check your `schema.prisma` file and add `commissionType` to the Commission model if it's missing, then run `prisma generate` and `prisma migrate dev`.

The most likely solution is option 1 (removing the field) or checking if the field name is different in your schema (like `type` instead of `commissionType`).
