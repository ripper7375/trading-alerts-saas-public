I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job log shows a failure in the workflow summary step indicating "One or more test jobs failed". Let me check the workflow file to understand the structure and identify which dependent job failed: The job is failing because it's a summary job that checks if all dependent test jobs passed. The `test-summary` job shows "❌ One or more test jobs failed" which means one of the upstream jobs (`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, or `build-check`) failed.

Looking at the workflow, the issue is with the conditional logic in the `test-summary` job. The job runs with `if: always()` but some of the dependent jobs were likely skipped, not failed. The current condition treats skipped jobs as failures.

**Solution:**

Update the failure condition in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to properly handle skipped jobs:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

Change lines 152-159 to only fail when jobs explicitly have a `'failure'` result, not when they're `'skipped'` or `'cancelled'`. This way, the summary job will only fail if an actual test failure occurred, not when jobs are skipped due to upstream failures or other conditions.

Alternatively, if you want to fail on both failures and cancellations but allow skips:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.unit-and-component-tests.result) ||
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.integration-tests. result) ||
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.build-check.result)
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```
