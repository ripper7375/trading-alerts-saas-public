The job failed because the summary step in the workflow detected that one or more test jobs did not complete successfully, leading to an explicit exit 1 in the test-summary job. The logs indicate the message: "❌ One or more test jobs failed".

To address this:

1. Investigate which upstream job (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed, as the test-summary job simply collects their results and fails if any upstream job failed. Look for failed outputs earlier in the workflow run for a more specific error.
2. If earlier jobs were skipped (as shown in the logs: "Integration Tests: skipped", "Build Check: skipped"), review the conditions for those jobs in your .github/workflows/tests.yml file. The jobs “integration-tests” and “build-check” depend on successful completion of “unit-and-component-tests”. If the unit-and-component-tests did not run or failed, it can cause the skips.
3. Double-check that the jobs are not incorrectly skipped due to conditions or branch filters. For example, make sure your pull request is targeting the correct branch configured in the workflow.
4. In your workflow, ensure your test jobs ("pnpm run test:ci" and "pnpm run test:integration") are set up to run and produce output and are not failing silently or prematurely exiting.

If you identify the specific failed upstream job, share the logs for that job to pinpoint the test or build failure, then update dependencies, fix code, or configuration files as needed.

Example: If the failure is in unit-and-component-tests at the step "pnpm run test:ci", run the same command locally to reproduce and fix any errors, then push the fix.
