The job is failing due to a TypeScript type error in app/api/disbursement/affiliates/[affiliateId]/commissions/route.ts on line 61. The error says:

Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'subscription' does not exist in type 'CommissionInclude<DefaultArgs>'.

This means the code is attempting to include a 'subscription' relation in the Prisma query for the Commission model, but according to your Prisma schema, Commission does not have a 'subscription' relation, or it is not named this way.

Solution:

1. Open your Prisma schema (typically prisma/schema.prisma).
2. Verify the Commission model for a relation named subscription. If it is missing or named differently, update your query accordingly.
3. If the correct relation is something like userSubscription, change your include block in the query to:

```typescript
include: {
  userSubscription: {
    select: {
      user: {
        select: {
          email: true,
          name: true,
        },
      },
      tier: true,
    },
  },
},
```

Otherwise, if the Commission model is not supposed to include any subscription-like relation, remove the subscription key from your include block entirely.

After correcting the property to match your schema, the build should pass. You can view the precise error in context here:
