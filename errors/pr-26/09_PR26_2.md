I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. I can see this is a summary job that failed because one or more test jobs failed. Let me get the full workflow logs to see which specific test job(s) failed:The job is failing because it's a summary job that depends on other test jobs, and one or more of those upstream jobs failed. The error message "❌ One or more test jobs failed" indicates this is a status check job, not the actual failing test.

To find the root cause, you need to check the other jobs in the same workflow run. The failing job (58669194305) is just reporting that a dependency failed.

**Solution:**

1. Look at the workflow run for PR #26 and identify which specific test job(s) actually failed (e.g., "Unit Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Build Check")
2. Check the logs of those failing jobs to see the actual error

**Workflow Structure Issue:**

Please check the workflow file to understand the job dependencies
