I'll analyze the failing job 58669167546 to identify the issue and provide a solution. ## Solution

The TypeScript compilation is failing because the `commissions` query on line 55-62 doesn't include the `commissionType` field, but line 109 tries to access it.

**The Issue:**
At line 109, you're trying to access `c.commissionType`, but the Prisma query doesn't select this field from the database. TypeScript correctly identifies that this property doesn't exist on the returned type.

**Fix:**
You need to add `commissionType` to the fields being selected in the `commissions` include. However, since you're using `include` without a `select`, all fields should already be included. This suggests the `commissionType` column might not exist in your Prisma schema for the Commission model.

**Two possible solutions:**

1. **If `commissionType` exists in your schema**, the query should work. Verify your Prisma schema and regenerate the Prisma client:

   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. **If `commissionType` doesn't exist**, you need to either:
   - Remove line 109 that references `commissionType`:
     ```typescript
     pendingCommissions: profile.commissions.map((c) => ({
       id: c.id,
       amount: Number(c.commissionAmount),
       // Remove the type field
       createdAt: c.createdAt,
     })),
     ```
   - Or add the field to your Prisma schema and run a migration:
     ```prisma
     model Commission {
       // ... other fields
       commissionType String?
       // ... other fields
     }
     ```

Check your Prisma schema file to determine which approach is correct for your codebase.
