I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing because it's a summary job that checks if any test jobs failed. Let me get the workflow file and check the PR to see which test jobs actually failed: ## Solution

The failing job is the **Test Summary** job, which is detecting that one or more of the dependent test jobs (`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, or `build-check`) has failed. The logs show that both Integration Tests and Build Check were skipped, indicating the `unit-and-component-tests` job failed.

### Root Cause

The `test-summary` job (lines 152-159 in the workflow) fails when any of its dependent jobs don't have a `success` status. The logs indicate Integration Tests and Build Check show as "skipped", which means the upstream `unit-and-component-tests` job failed, causing the dependent jobs to be skipped.

### Fix

You need to check the logs of the **Unit & Component Tests** job to find the actual failure. The test-summary job is working as designed - it's just reporting that an earlier job failed.

To see the root cause, look at the logs for the `unit-and-component-tests` job in this workflow run. The failure is likely in one of these steps:

- TypeScript check (`pnpm run type-check`)
- ESLint (`pnpm run lint`)
- Unit/component tests (`pnpm run test:ci`)

Once you identify the specific error in the Unit & Component Tests job, you can fix the underlying issue (likely a test failure, type error, or linting issue).
