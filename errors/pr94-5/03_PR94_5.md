The failure occurred in the final summary step of your workflow, which checks the results of the upstream jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check). The log indicates that at least one test job failed, causing the summary step to exit with code 1:

```
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

To resolve this, review the outputs and logs of the individual jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) to pinpoint which job reported "failure". Once identified, address the root cause of the failure in that job (for example, a failing test, lint error, type-check error, or bundle size limit breach).

If you want to prevent the summary job from failing the workflow (so results are just summarized), you can remove or comment out the following lines in .github/workflows/tests.yml at the end of the test-summary job (lines 153–159):

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

This will allow the workflow to complete and show the summary even if one or more jobs failed, without returning a failure code at this step. For best results, still review and address the underlying failed job in the upstream steps.
