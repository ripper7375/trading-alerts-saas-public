The job failed due to multiple TypeScript errors, primarily related to properties not existing on the FraudAlert type, and missing Prisma enums. Here’s how to fix these issues:

1. **Missing Properties on FraudAlert**  
   TypeScript errors such as `Property 'amount' does not exist on type 'FraudAlert'` suggest that your Prisma Client types (generated from `prisma/schema.prisma`) do not include fields like `amount`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, etc.  
   However, reviewing your schema, the `FraudAlert` model does define these fields:

   ```prisma
   model FraudAlert {
     ...
     amount         Decimal?
     createdAt      DateTime @default(now())
     updatedAt      DateTime @updatedAt
     ...
   }
   ```

   This strongly indicates your Prisma Client is out of sync with the schema.

   **Solution:**  
   Regenerate your Prisma Client after any schema change:

   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

   Or, in your project build scripts/workflow, ensure this runs after migrations.

2. **Import Errors for Prisma Enums**  
   Errors like `Module '@prisma/client' has no exported member 'FraudAlertSeverity'.`  
   Your schema defines enums `FraudAlertSeverity` and `FraudAlertStatus`:

   ```prisma
   enum FraudAlertStatus { ... }
   enum FraudAlertSeverity { ... }
   ```

   These are available from `@prisma/client` only if your generated types are up to date.

   **Solution:**  
   Same as above, regenerate your Prisma Client:

   ```
   npx prisma generate
   ```

3. **Pattern, Country, PaymentMethod, Currency, Status, Etc.**  
   All these properties exist in your schema:
   - `pattern String`
   - `country String?`
   - `paymentMethod String?`
   - `amount Decimal?`
   - `currency String?`
   - `status FraudAlertStatus`

   If you see errors for any of these as missing from `FraudAlert`, it’s also a Prisma Client regeneration issue.

4. **Properties from an Index Signature**  
   TypeScript errors like

   ```
   Property 'severity' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['severity'].
   ```

   mean you need to use square bracket syntax:

   ```typescript
   item['severity'];
   ```

   rather than

   ```typescript
   item.severity;
   ```

   Update your code in `lib/fraud/fraud-detection.service.ts`, e.g.:

   ```typescript
   severityCounts[item['severity']] = item._count['severity'];
   ```

5. **Unused Variables (`TS6133: 'req' is declared but its value is never read.`)**  
   This warning at `app/api/admin/fraud-alerts/[id]/route.ts(36,3)` is cosmetic and can be safely ignored or resolved by removing `req` if not used.

**Summary of Actions:**

- Run `npx prisma generate` to update your Prisma Client types.
- Update any property access from index signatures to use bracket notation.
- If errors persist, ensure your build pipeline is not caching old Prisma/TypeScript artifacts.

These actions should resolve the current CI failures.
