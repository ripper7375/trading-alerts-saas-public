The job failed due to ESLint errors in lib/fraud/fraud-detection.service.ts:

1. Line 217: deviceFingerprint is assigned but never used.
2. Line 369: byStatus is assigned but never used.

To resolve these, either use the variables or prefix them with _ to comply with the eslint rule /^_/u for unused vars. Here are the code corrections:

**Line 217**
Change:

```typescript
const { userId, ipAddress, country, deviceFingerprint } = context;
```

To:

```typescript
const {
  userId,
  ipAddress,
  country,
  deviceFingerprint: _deviceFingerprint,
} = context;
```

(or use deviceFingerprint if required).

**Line 369**
Change:

```typescript
const [total, bySeverity, byStatus, pending] = await Promise.all([
```

To:

```typescript
const [total, bySeverity, _byStatus, pending] = await Promise.all([
```

Apply these fixes in lib/fraud/fraud-detection.service.ts ([view file @ c7e4149a](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/c7e4149a76a43bb8669f02240fb0ab0f5666ebd3/lib/fraud/fraud-detection.service.ts)). This will resolve the lint errors and allow the job to pass.
