Job 58964680543 failed because one or more of the unit and component tests, integration tests, or the production build check did not succeed. The workflow’s final step is designed to fail if any of these jobs do not return success.

Solution:

1. Check the individual results for:
   - Unit & Component Tests (unit-and-component-tests)
   - Integration Tests (integration-tests)
   - Production Build Check (build-check)

2. The log summary in this job shows that both Integration Tests and Build Check were skipped:

   ```
   - ✅ Integration Tests: skipped
   - ✅ Build Check: skipped
   ❌ One or more test jobs failed
   ```

3. This suggests the root cause is a previous job (most likely unit-and-component-tests) did not complete successfully, resulting in dependent jobs being skipped.

To address this:

- Inspect the logs for the unit-and-component-tests job to find the specific error/failure.
- Resolve any test, TypeScript, lint, or dependency problems highlighted in the earlier steps of that job.
- The most common issues are test failures or lint/type-check errors. Fix these in your codebase, then commit and push to rerun the workflow.

If you need help fixing a specific error in unit-and-component-tests, share the output from that job’s log around the point of failure, and I can provide targeted code suggestions.
