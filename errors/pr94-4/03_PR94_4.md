The job failed because the test-summary job in your workflow is configured to fail if any of the dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) did not succeed. According to the logs, either integration tests or the build check were skipped, leading to this summary failure by running:

```bash
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

To prevent this, adjust your test-summary step in .github/workflows/tests.yml so that it only fails when actual test jobs fail, not when they are skipped. Replace the failure condition in the Fail if any test failed step:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

with:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|           # only fail if any job actually failed, ignore 'skipped'
```

Or make it explicit to ignore 'skipped':

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Also, review why integration tests or build checks are being skipped, and ensure their triggers match your intentions.
