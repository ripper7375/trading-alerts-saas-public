The "Production Build Check" job failed. According to the workflow in .github/workflows/tests.yml and the logs for job 59211479443, the step that often causes failures is the "Build Next.js" or subsequent bundle size check. Your logs indicate only a generic failure but not the exact step.

The most common causes for this job to fail are:

- The Next.js build fails (likely in pnpm run build),
- The bundle size exceeds specified limits (build produces a .next directory greater than threshold limits).

Solution steps:

1. Check and fix any build errors in your Next.js project:
   - Run pnpm run build locally on the branch (commit dd9acd4ed099d77c87c6a8f3ed311b127cbcb24c).
   - Address any TypeScript, missing modules, or build errors it reports.
2. Check your bundle size:
   - After a successful build, run du -sm .next/ to see the bundle size in MB.
   - If it exceeds 500MB, aggressively remove/optimize large dependencies, images, or unused code.
   - If between 370MB and 500MB, consider lazy-loading modules, reducing package size, or excluding development tools from production builds.
3. If the build uses environment variables, ensure any required .env.production files or values are present/not missing.
4. If the problem is a bundle size warning (not hard fail): bundle size under 450MB passes, but above this fails. Your code changes should specifically target reducing size under these thresholds (see bundle size threshold logic in your workflow).

Example code suggestion (to analyze large dependencies):
In next.config.js:

```js
const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});
module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({});
```

Then run ANALYZE=true pnpm run build to see what makes the bundle large.

Focus on fixing build errors and/or reducing bundle size as described above to resolve this CI failure.
