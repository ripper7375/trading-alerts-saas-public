The job failed because the specifiers in the lockfile don't match those in package.json: specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 was added to package.json, but the lockfile was not updated.

To fix this, run the following command in your project root:

```
npm install
```

or, if you use yarn:

```
yarn install
```

This will update the lockfile to match the dependencies in package.json. After updating, commit both package.json and the updated lockfile (usually package-lock.json or yarn.lock) to your branch.

Refer to the line in package.json where next-themes is defined:  
"next-themes": "^0.4.4" ([view in package.json](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/7360dbc64d9ac614042e133469c4ef8a8a8d30da/package.json#L88))

Make sure you do not manually edit the lockfile; always use your package manager to keep it in sync.
