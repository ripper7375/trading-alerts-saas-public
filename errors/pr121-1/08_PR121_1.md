The job failed because the dependency next-themes@^0.4.4 was listed in package.json but missing from package-lock.json. This specifier mismatch causes the lockfile check to fail during CI.

**Solution:**  
Regenerate the lockfile so it matches the current package.json:

```sh
pnpm install
```

or if you use npm:

```sh
npm install
```

After updating the lockfile, commit both package.json and package-lock.json. This ensures consistency and will resolve the lockfile CI failure.

**Summary of issue:**

- next-themes@^0.4.4 is now in package.json ([view file](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/7360dbc64d9ac614042e133469c4ef8a8a8d30da/package.json), ref: 7360dbc64d9ac614042e133469c4ef8a8a8d30da)
- Not present in package-lock.json ([view file](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/7360dbc64d9ac614042e133469c4ef8a8a8d30da/package-lock.json), same ref)
- Solution: Run a clean install and commit the changes to both files.
