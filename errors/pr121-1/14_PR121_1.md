The job failed because the dependencies in your lockfile (package-lock.json) do not match the dependencies in your package.json—specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 was added to package.json but this change isn't reflected in package-lock.json.

**Solution:**  
Run the following command locally to update your lockfile to match package.json:

```sh
pnpm install
```

or, if using npm:

```sh
npm install
```

Then commit and push the updated package-lock.json file. This will resolve the lockfile mismatch and allow your CI job to pass.
