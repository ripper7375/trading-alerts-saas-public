The job failed because the dependencies in your lockfile do not match those in your package.json. Specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 was added to package.json but not synced in the lockfile.

Solution:

1. Run the appropriate package manager install command to update the lockfile:

If you use npm:

```sh
npm install
```

If you use Yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

If you use pnpm:

```sh
pnpm install
```

2. Commit and push the updated lockfile (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, or pnpm-lock.yaml) to your branch.

This will resolve the sync issue between package.json and your lockfile, allowing the workflow to pass.
