The job failed because the dependencies in the lockfile do not match those in package.json. Specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 was added as a dependency in package.json, but the lockfile (likely package-lock.json or yarn.lock) was not updated accordingly.

Solution:

1. Run the dependency install command to update the lockfile:
   - If you use npm:
     ```
     npm install
     ```
   - If you use yarn:
     ```
     yarn install
     ```

2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) along with your changes to package.json.

This will synchronize the lockfile with your current dependencies and resolve the CI failure.
