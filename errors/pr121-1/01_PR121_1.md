The failure occurred because the lockfile does not match specifiers in package.json—specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 was added to package.json but this change was not reflected in the lockfile.

Solution:

1. Run the following command in your project root to update your lockfile:
   For npm:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
   For yarn:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```
2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) along with your package.json changes.

Reason: This will synchronize your lockfile with package.json, resolving the dependency mismatch error and allowing CI to pass.

Let me know if you need the exact commands based on your package manager, or if you’d like guidance on the other (unrelated) database role error seen in the logs.
