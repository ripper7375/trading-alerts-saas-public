The job failed due to the workflow step in test-summary that runs this script:

```bash
if [ needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ] ||
   [ needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ] ||
   [ needs.build-check.result == 'failure' ]; then
  echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
  exit 1
fi
```

However, the logs indicate both Integration Tests and Build Check were skipped:

```
- ✅ Integration Tests: skipped
- ✅ Build Check: skipped
❌ One or more test jobs failed
```

This suggests the summary/notification step (test-summary) is running even when required jobs were skipped instead of failed, causing a false positive failure.

**Solution:**  
Update the conditional in the test-summary job to only run when dependencies have actually finished, and treat skipped jobs appropriately. Replace:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

with

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1

- name: Mark as skipped if all needed jobs skipped
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'skipped' &&
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'skipped' &&
    needs.build-check.result == 'skipped'
  run: |
    echo "⚠️ All test jobs skipped, summary job exiting"
    exit 0
```

Alternatively, adapt your workflow triggers or conditionals to prevent summary steps from running when all test jobs were skipped.
