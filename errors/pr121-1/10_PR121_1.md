The job failed because the specifiers in your lockfile (package-lock.json) don't match the dependencies listed in package.json. Specifically, next-themes@^0.4.4 has been added to package.json but is missing from package-lock.json under dependencies.

**Solution:**
Regenerate your lockfile so it matches the updated dependencies:

1. Delete package-lock.json and node_modules:
   ```sh
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   ```
2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Commit the updated package-lock.json:
   ```sh
   git add package-lock.json
   git commit -m "Fix: sync lockfile after adding next-themes"
   ```

This will resolve the inconsistency by ensuring next-themes@^0.4.4 is reflected in both files.
