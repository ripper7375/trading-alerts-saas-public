The failure in job 59001158337 is caused by a summary step that checks the statuses of previous jobs and exits with error if any test job failed. The logs show both integration tests and build checks were skipped, leading the summary step to mark them as "failed" due to missing or incomplete dependencies.

Solution:

- Ensure all required jobs (“unit-and-component-tests”, “integration-tests”, “build-check”) are properly triggered and not skipped on this pull request.
- Confirm your pull request targets a branch listed in the jobs’ “on” configuration: main, develop, or matching the claude/\*\* pattern (see tests.yml, lines 4-7).
- If branch filters are correct, verify that “unit-and-component-tests” is not failing or being skipped, as this will prevent subsequent jobs (“integration-tests”, “build-check”) from running.

If legitimate skips are expected for some jobs (e.g., on specific branches or PRs), edit the “test-summary” job in .github/workflows/tests.yml ([view file](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8c1a0567507549044481f899ef65e4a29405c4dd/.github/workflows/tests.yml)) to handle skipped outcomes gracefully, e.g.:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
# Change to
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  && (
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result != 'skipped' &&
    needs.integration-tests.result != 'skipped' &&
    needs.build-check.result != 'skipped'
  )
```

Alternatively, ensure skipped jobs are not incorrectly marked as failures downstream in the summary step. Review job triggers and dependencies for correctness.
