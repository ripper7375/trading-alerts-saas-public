The main causes of job 59001133570 failures are:

1. **Database errors in admin endpoints**
   - Errors occur in API routes for admin P&L reports, affiliates, and users, showing database queries failing. These routes all rely on the Prisma client connecting to your database.  
     **Solution**:
     - Ensure your database connection credentials (host, user, password, and database name) are set and correct in your deployment and CI environment.
     - Check that the database service is accessible from your runners.
     - If using SQLite in CI, switch to an in-memory setup or a safer DB for testing full flows.

2. **CRON_SECRET not configured**
   - The cron job at `app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts` ([ref](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8c1a0567507549044481f899ef65e4a29405c4dd/app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts)) fails with "CRON_SECRET not configured". This is required for authentication.
     **Solution**:
     - Add the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable with the required value in both your local `.env` and CI/CD environment settings.

3. **Coverage upload errors**
   - Codecov fails: “Token required - not valid tokenless upload” and "No coverage reports found".
     **Solution**:
     - In your CI provider (GitHub Actions), set the Codecov upload token as a secret, e.g., `CODECOV_TOKEN`.
     - Ensure your tests generate a `coverage/lcov.info` file by configuring your test runner (e.g., Jest, with `coverageDirectory` set in `jest.config.js`).

4. **Test failures**
   - In `__tests__/api/indicators.test.ts` ([ref](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8c1a0567507549044481f899ef65e4a29405c4dd/__tests__/api/indicators.test.ts)), a test fails because it expects `proIndicatorsTransformed` in the response data but it’s not present.  
     **Solution**:
     - Ensure the mocked or actual implementation for `/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]` includes the `proIndicatorsTransformed` key in the response data during tests for the FREE tier.
     - Update your mock data in the test to include this field:
       ```typescript
       const mockData = {
         // ...other fields
         proIndicatorsTransformed: {},
       };
       ```

5. **Test failures in auth validation**
   - The test in `__tests__/lib/validations/auth.test.ts` ([ref](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/8c1a0567507549044481f899ef65e4a29405c4dd/__tests__/lib/validations/auth.test.ts)) is likely failing not due to the schema but possibly due to a mock or environment variable problem. Check that all required test setups and mocks are in place.

**Summary of fixes:**

- Configure all required environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `CRON_SECRET`, `CODECOV_TOKEN`) in your CI and test environments.
- Ensure the database is reachable during CI jobs.
- Adjust coverage/test settings so coverage output exists when Codecov runs.
- Update indicator API test to mock/include any expected fields accurately.

This will resolve your failing job if each error is addressed as described.
