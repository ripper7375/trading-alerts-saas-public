The job failed due to a TypeScript ESLint error on line 69 of components/auth/register-form.tsx: 'reset' is assigned a value but never used. To fix this, remove reset from the destructuring assignment returned by useForm on line 63-70:

Replace:

```tsx
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  watch,
  setValue,
  formState: { errors, touchedFields, isValid },
  reset,
} = useForm<RegistrationFormData>({...});
```

with:

```tsx
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  watch,
  setValue,
  formState: { errors, touchedFields, isValid }
} = useForm<RegistrationFormData>({...});
```

Or, if you need to keep reset for future use but want to pass linting, rename it to \_reset to match the allowed unused variable rule:

```tsx
const {
  register,
  handleSubmit,
  watch,
  setValue,
  formState: { errors, touchedFields, isValid },
  reset: _reset,
} = useForm<RegistrationFormData>({...});
```

Choose one of these adjustments in components/auth/register-form.tsx at ref eed028907390707e502e32df9d5c059460779384 to resolve the failure.
