The failing job 59052361749 in your workflow was caused by the command exit 1 after detecting at least one failed test job. The relevant logic is in the test-summary job in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: eed028907390707e502e32df9d5c059460779384). This step intentionally fails the workflow if any of the previous jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) did not succeed:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

Solution:

- Identify which specific test job (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) is failing by reviewing previous job results in the workflow run.
- Address the root cause in the failing job. For example, review test failures in the corresponding test scripts, dependency issues, or build errors.
- Once the underlying failure is fixed, the final summary job will no longer trigger the exit 1, and the workflow will pass as intended.

If you need help with a specific test job failure, please provide the logs or error messages from that job.
