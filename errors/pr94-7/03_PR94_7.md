The failure occurred because at least one of the required jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) did not complete successfully. The test-summary job is set to fail if any of these dependencies fail, using this check:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

To solve this:

1. Review the logs for unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check to identify which job(s) failed and why.
2. Address the root cause in the specific job:
   - For test failures: Fix the failing tests or underlying implementation.
   - For dependency issues: Ensure all dependencies install without error.
   - For lint/type errors: Fix code to pass `pnpm run lint` and `pnpm run type-check`.
   - For bundle size errors in build-check: Keep the build output under 350MB.

After making these fixes, push your changes to trigger the workflow again.
