The job failed because at least one of the test jobs (unit, integration, or build check) failed or was skipped, which triggers the summary step to exit with an error. The logs specifically state:

❌ One or more test jobs failed

Based on the workflow in .github/workflows/tests.yml (ref: c325c28c67580c6263a900bf23876df3c027f617), this summary step checks the status of the needs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check). If any were unsuccessful or skipped, it fails. The logs also show lines indicating tests were skipped:

echo "| Integration Tests | skipped |" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY  
echo "| Build Check | skipped |" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY

Solution:

- Ensure all required jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) are configured to run and not be conditionally skipped.
- Confirm that the triggers (“on” block) in the workflow allow these jobs to execute for your pull request branch.
- Make sure required test scripts (such as test:ci and test:integration in package.json) exist and run properly.
- Double-check for any previous failed or skipped jobs; fix errors in those jobs so that downstream steps do not skip or fail due to dependencies.

If jobs are being skipped incorrectly, update the workflow’s on: and needs: configuration to include your PR branch. If you see preceding errors in the logs of unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check jobs, fix those root issues to restore normal passing status for the summary job.
