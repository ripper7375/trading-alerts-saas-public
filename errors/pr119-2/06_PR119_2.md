Job 59052916359 failed because one or more required test jobs did not pass. The workflow’s "Test Summary" step checks the completion status of the dependent jobs: "Unit & Component Tests," "Integration Tests," and "Production Build Check." If any of these are marked as failed, the summary job fails with exit code 1.

To solve this:

1. Review and fix any errors causing failure in:
   - Unit & Component Tests (step runs pnpm run test:ci)
   - Integration Tests (step runs pnpm run test:integration)
   - Production Build Check (may fail if Next.js bundle exceeds 365MB, see build size check logic)
2. Push fixes so each job returns a "success" status.

Common suggestions:

- Check your test and lint outputs for failing assertions or errors.
- For build failures, verify your Next.js output size; optimize or remove unused code/assets if it exceeds 365MB.
- Ensure Prisma generation and dependency installation steps complete successfully.

For your workflow, you can see the logic in the test summary step:

```bash
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 365 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 365MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Review logs for each job to isolate the exact failing step and error details. Fix the root cause in code or configuration, then re-run the checks.
