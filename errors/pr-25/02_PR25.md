I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me first get the logs to see what's causing the failure. ## Solution for TypeScript Error in commission-aggregator.ts

The build is failing due to a type mismatch on line 149. The `riseAccount. kycStatus` property is incompatible between the returned object type and the expected `PayableAffiliate` type.

### Issue

On lines 180-182, when there's no RiseWorks account, you're setting `kycStatus` to the string `'none'`, but the `PayableAffiliate` type likely expects a specific enum or union type that doesn't include `'none'`.

### Fix

Update line 182 to use `null` or `undefined` instead of the string `'none'`:

```typescript
riseAccount: {
  hasAccount: hasRiseAccount,
  riseId: affiliate.riseAccount?.riseId,
  kycStatus: hasRiseAccount
    ? affiliate. riseAccount?.kycStatus ??  'PENDING'
    :  null, // Change 'none' to null
  canReceivePayments,
},
```

Alternatively, if you need to keep the `'none'` value, you'll need to update the `PayableAffiliate` type definition in `@/types/disbursement` to include `'none'` as a valid value for `kycStatus`:

```typescript
// In types/disbursement.ts
kycStatus: 'APPROVED' | 'PENDING' | 'REJECTED' | 'none' | null;
```

The first approach (using `null`) is recommended as it's more idiomatic TypeScript for representing the absence of a value.
