The failing job 59064701476 was caused by a step in the workflow that exits with code 1 when any required test job fails. According to the logs, both the Integration Tests and Build Check jobs were skipped, which implies their dependencies or trigger conditions were not satisfied—often because the "unit-and-component-tests" job did not run or complete successfully.

**Solution:**

1. Ensure that the "unit-and-component-tests" job runs and passes. Check that files and configuration for unit tests (`pnpm run test:ci`) are present, properly set up, and that there are no missing dependencies.
2. In your workflow definition (see [.github/workflows/tests.yml](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/a0877f912950b554163079a2af64efc6ce6c9f7a/.github/workflows/tests.yml)), confirm that matrix values, Node.js setup, and the `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` step are functioning and the correct versions are being used.
3. If you intend to only skip jobs under specific circumstances, adjust your workflow triggers or add explicit conditional logic to avoid unintended skips and failures.
4. If test scripts (such as `test:ci`, `test:integration`, or build commands) are missing, add them to your `package.json`. For example:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test:ci": "your-unit-test-command",
  "test:integration": "your-integration-test-command",
  "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
  "lint": "eslint ."
}
```

5. Review any recent changes to your workflow file or dependency versions that could affect job execution.

By ensuring all required test jobs are properly configured and triggered, and that dependencies/scripts exist, the summary step will not fail and the overall job will succeed.
