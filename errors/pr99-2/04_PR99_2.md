The failure is caused by the "Test Summary" job exiting with status 1 because one or more required jobs failed or were skipped, as shown by the logs:

```
❌ One or more test jobs failed
exit 1
```

According to the workflow definition (.github/workflows/tests.yml), the Test Summary job checks the results of unit, integration, and build jobs. If any of these are skipped or fail, the summary job fails too. In your logs, "Integration Tests" and "Build Check" were both skipped, which triggers a failure.

Solution:

- Ensure all jobs ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", "build-check") run in all scenarios. The most common cause for jobs being skipped is when their trigger conditions (branch or PR targets) don't match.
- In your YAML, "push" and "pull_request" only include specific branches (main, develop). If you're testing on another branch, add it to the workflow triggers.

Example (in .github/workflows/tests.yml):

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [main, develop, claude/**, your-feature-branch]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop, your-feature-branch]
```

- Confirm that no earlier job (like "unit-and-component-tests") is being skipped; otherwise, dependent jobs will skip.

By updating your workflow to ensure all branches of interest are included under "on: push" and "on: pull_request", and confirming all dependencies are satisfied, the test summary will only fail if an actual test or build fails. Review the branch/PR configuration and ensure you commit these changes to the correct ref: 5bde4e6fea77beeb916868161cc66497f22a174e.
