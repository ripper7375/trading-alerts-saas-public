The job failed due to a TypeScript error: the variable req is declared in the DELETE function but never read (see line 26 in app/api/user/sessions/[id]/route.ts at ref 9878cfc123af292ceeaf96b5347fbd1c9c58c111). To resolve this, remove req from the function signature if it’s not needed:

Replace:

```typescript
export async function DELETE(
  req: NextRequest,
  context: RouteContext
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

with:

```typescript
export async function DELETE(
  context: RouteContext
): Promise<NextResponse> {
```

and update any calls as needed. This will fix the compilation error and allow the job to pass. See the definition here for reference: [route.ts](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/9878cfc123af292ceeaf96b5347fbd1c9c58c111/app/api/user/sessions/%5Bid%5D/route.ts).
