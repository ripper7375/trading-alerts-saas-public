The failing job (ID: 59037493832) in your workflow is caused by the step in .github/workflows/tests.yml that checks if any required jobs failed before summarizing results:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

The logs show:

```
❌ One or more test jobs failed
exit 1
Process completed with exit code 1.
```

This means at least one of the jobs "Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Build Check" did not pass, triggering the summary job to fail intentionally.

**Solution:**

1. Review the earlier jobs in the workflow (unit tests, integration tests, and build check). Fix any code issues, failed tests, unmet dependencies, or build problems in those jobs.
2. If jobs are being skipped incorrectly (as logs suggest for "Integration Tests" and "Build Check"), check for conditional logic, outdated branch filtering, or missing triggers. Ensure your workflow conditions allow these jobs to run as expected.
3. Once the underlying jobs pass, this summary step will succeed.

**Code suggestion:**  
To diagnose individual job failures, rerun checks and view logs for the "Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", and "Build Check" jobs specifically. After all pass, no changes are needed to the summary job.
