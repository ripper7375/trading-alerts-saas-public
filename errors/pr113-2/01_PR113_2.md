The job failed due to a TypeScript error in app/api/user/sessions/[id]/route.ts (line 26): "'req' is declared but its value is never read." To resolve this, remove the unused req parameter or replace it with an underscore (\_) to indicate it’s intentionally unused.

Suggested fix:

```typescript
export async function DELETE(
  _: NextRequest, // Instead of `req`
  context: RouteContext
): Promise<NextResponse> {
  // ...rest of your code...
}
```

or simply remove it if your framework allows.  
See the file for reference at commit 9878cfc123af292ceeaf96b5347fbd1c9c58c111:  
app/api/user/sessions/[id]/route.ts

This change will fix the type error and unblock your build.
