The failing job is caused by the production bundle size exceeding the allowed threshold. The workflow’s "Check bundle size" step calculates the size of the .next/ directory after building with Next.js and fails if it’s greater than 380MB. Your current bundle size is 383MB.

Solution:

- Reduce the production bundle size below 380MB. Common approaches include:
  - Removing unused dependencies or large assets.
  - Dynamically importing heavy modules only where needed.
  - Reviewing image, font, or static file usage in the /public and /assets directories.
  - Using Next.js’s built-in optimization features (e.g., next/image, code splitting).
- After making changes, your bundle size can be checked locally with:
  du -sm .next/
- Confirm the bundle size is within limit before pushing.
