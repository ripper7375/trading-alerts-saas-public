The failure is caused by the "Build Check" job in your workflow, which runs pnpm run build for your Next.js project. The summary indicates:

- Integration Tests: success
- Build Check: failure

The relevant "Build Check" step runs pnpm run build and enforces a maximum Next.js build bundle size of 380MB:

```bash
BUNDLE_SIZE=$(du -sm .next/ | cut -f1)
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 380 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 380MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Solution:

- Check your .next/ directory build size locally with du -sm .next/.
- If your bundle size is above 380MB, reduce it by:
  - Removing unused packages and dependencies.
  - Leveraging dynamic imports to split large bundle parts.
  - Optimizing images and static assets.
  - Removing unnecessary files/output from the .next/ directory or cleaning before build.

If you intend to allow a larger bundle size (not recommended), increase the threshold in .github/workflows/tests.yml (line 131):

```bash
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 380 ]; then
```

to a higher value (e.g., 400), but be aware this may have deployment or performance consequences.

Review the build logs for specific errors or warnings during pnpm run build—fix any issues reported there.
