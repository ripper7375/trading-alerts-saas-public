The failing job 59016436355 failed due to this step in the workflow:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

This step runs if any of the jobs unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check failed. The logs indicate that test jobs (integration or build-check) were skipped, which means the dependencies required for this summary job to pass were not met, causing it to fail by default.

Solution:

- Ensure that all required jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, and build-check) are not skipped and complete successfully.
- If you are intentionally skipping tests, adjust the dependencies or the summary job conditions in .github/workflows/tests.yml (see on ref d977f40e80fa062ff6d3c8ace1dcf1e61aaab5e3) to handle skipped jobs appropriately. For example, change the job dependencies or the summary step to account for skipped statuses:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

You may want to further check that a job is not skipped using:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Or handle "skipped" states to avoid false test summary failures.

Address the root cause for any skipped or failed job prior to the summary.
