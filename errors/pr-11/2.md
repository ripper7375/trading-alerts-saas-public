The job failed due to a TypeScript error on line 67 of app/admin/affiliates/[id]/page.tsx:

Property 'id' comes from an index signature, so it must be accessed with ['id'].

To fix this, update line 67:

Replace:

```tsx
const affiliateId = params.id as string;
```

With:

```tsx
const affiliateId = params['id'] as string;
```

This change correctly accesses the dynamic route param according to Next.js and TypeScript index signature requirements.
