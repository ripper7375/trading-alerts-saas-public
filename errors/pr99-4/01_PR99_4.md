The failing job (59017186849) has several types of failures, but the main problem is in the test file **tests**/api/indicators.test.ts:

- The test "should handle MT5ServiceError" expects the response to be "MT5 service error", but the API is returning "Internal server error".
- The relevant error comes from this assertion:
  ```
  Expected: "MT5 service error"
  Received: "Internal server error"
  ```

**Solution:**

1. Update your error handling in the API route for /api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe] so that it specifically catches MT5ServiceError and returns "MT5 service error" in the response.

For example, in your API handler (likely in app/api/indicators/[symbol]/[timeframe]/route.ts or a related controller):

```typescript
try {
  // existing code, e.g., call to MT5Service
} catch (error) {
  if (error instanceof MT5ServiceError) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'MT5 service error' }, { status: 500 });
  }
  // fallback for other errors
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Internal server error' }, { status: 500 });
}
```

2. Double-check that you are importing/using the MT5ServiceError class/type from your MT5 service module.

**Other Issues Not Affecting Test Exit Code**:

- There are errors in your cron job endpoint: "CRON_SECRET not configured". Set the CRON_SECRET in your environment variables to fix the related warning.
- Codecov upload is failing because of missing config/token and no coverage files found. Add your Codecov token (as a secret in GitHub) and make sure you generate a coverage report during the CI run.

Link to the failing test lines for quick reference:

**Main solution:** Update your API error handling for MT5ServiceError as shown above, so your tested endpoint returns the expected error message.

If you provide your handler code (route or controller for /api/indicators), I can suggest the exact code changes.
