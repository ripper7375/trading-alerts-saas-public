The failing job 59017219075 is the "Test Summary" job. According to the logs and the workflow definition (.github/workflows/tests.yml, ref 2f2341a4ce6dd14a40b9cdf61415f6c677ff353c), this job fails if any of the dependent jobs ("Unit & Component Tests", "Integration Tests", or "Production Build Check") fail. The logs show:

```
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

This means at least one of the prior jobs failed or was skipped. The workflow skips the summary steps for jobs if "needs.integration-tests.result" or similar steps are not "success". To solve this issue:

1. Review the actual failing dependency job(s) ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", or "build-check") for their logs and errors.
2. Fix the underlying failure in the relevant job (most likely in test execution, environment setup, or build process).

If the failure is due to skipped jobs (for example, if "integration-tests" or "build-check" are skipped due to prior job failures), ensure that:

- All prior jobs are passing.
- The workflow matrix and conditional steps in the jobs are correctly set up so required jobs always run as expected.

After fixing the underlying test or build failure, the "Test Summary" job will succeed.

Relevant code for the failure:

```yaml
154|       - name: Fail if any test failed
155|         if: |
156|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
157|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
158|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
159|         run: |
160|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
161|           exit 1
```
