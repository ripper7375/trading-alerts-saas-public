The job failed due to a "module not found" error when compiling app/(dashboard)/admin/fraud-alerts/page.tsx. This is likely caused by a missing or misnamed import, or an unavailable module.

To solve this:

1. Check that all imported modules/components exist and are exported correctly:
   - '@/components/ui/card'
   - '@/components/ui/button'
   - '@/components/ui/checkbox'
   - '@/components/admin/FraudAlertCard'
   - '@/components/ui/pagination'
   - '@/hooks/use-toast'
   - '@/components/ui/toast-container'

2. Make sure these files exist at the expected paths and are committed. For example, verify the existence of components like components/admin/FraudAlertCard.tsx, components/ui/card.tsx, etc., relative to your src or app directory.

3. If you recently moved or renamed any file or folder, update the import paths accordingly in page.tsx.

Example fix if a file missing:
If '@/components/admin/FraudAlertCard' does not exist, create it or fix the import (e.g., import from '@/components/FraudAlertCard' if that is the correct path).

You can see the relevant code here for review:

- [app/(dashboard)/admin/fraud-alerts/page.tsx (bdbde959a0e232cef7788b311f3acfa506281623)](<https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/bdbde959a0e232cef7788b311f3acfa506281623/app/(dashboard)/admin/fraud-alerts/page.tsx>)

After correcting broken or missing imports, re-run your workflow.
