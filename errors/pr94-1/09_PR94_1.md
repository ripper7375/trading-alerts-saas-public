The job failed because the final Test Summary step in the workflow checks if any previous jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) failed. However, the logs indicate that both the Integration Tests and Build Check jobs were skipped:

```
echo "- ✅ Integration Tests: skipped"
echo "- ✅ Build Check: skipped"
```

The final step then issues:

```
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

This caused the “Process completed with exit code 1.”

To fix this, ensure that the required jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, build-check) are not skipped before reaching the test-summary job. Common causes for skips include conditional logic, branch targeting, or matrix filters. In your case, double-check that these jobs are enabled for pull requests into the target branches (main or develop).

If you intentionally want to skip some jobs (e.g., based on file paths or workflow filters), adjust the logic in the test-summary job so it only fails if an actual required job has the 'failure' result—not 'skipped'.

Example adjustment to test-summary's fail condition in .github/workflows/tests.yml:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

Change to:

```yaml
if: |
  needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
  needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  # Only consider as failed if not skipped
```

Or explicitly check for 'skipped' and exclude that from failing the workflow.

Review the test jobs' filtering and matching logic, especially branch and PR triggers ([see workflow file][link]), to ensure jobs run as expected.
