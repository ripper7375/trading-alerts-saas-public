The job failed due to a webpack error: the module ./app/(dashboard)/admin/fraud-alerts/page.tsx could not be compiled. This kind of error is typically triggered when a required dependency is missing, misnamed, or there’s a problem with an import or file resolution.

To resolve this:

1. Verify all imported modules in app/(dashboard)/admin/fraud-alerts/page.tsx are present and properly named.
   - For example, make sure these files exist and are named as used in the imports:
     - @/components/ui/card
     - @/components/ui/button
     - @/components/ui/checkbox
     - @/components/admin/FraudAlertCard
     - @/components/ui/pagination
     - @/hooks/use-toast
     - @/components/ui/toast-container
   - Also, ensure lucide-react is installed: add it with npm install lucide-react if missing.

2. If you’re using custom aliasing (like the @/ prefix), confirm your tsconfig.json and next.config.js (or jsconfig.json) are correctly set up for module resolution.

3. Check for typos or casing mismatches between import statements and actual filenames (especially on case-sensitive filesystems).

If a specific module is missing, install or restore it, or correct the import path. For more details, review the error at the official Next.js documentation: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/module-not-found

After fixing the missing or incorrect import(s), commit and push your changes to trigger a new build. If you need help with a particular import that looks suspicious, share its details here.
