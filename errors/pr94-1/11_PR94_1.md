Here’s how to fix the main errors from job 58999844329:

### 1. Cannot find module '@/components/ui/checkbox' or '@/lib/auth'

- Make sure these modules exist at the corresponding paths (e.g., `components/ui/checkbox.tsx`, `lib/auth.ts`).
- If you recently moved or renamed files, update your imports accordingly.
- If using a custom TypeScript path alias (`@`), ensure your `tsconfig.json` or `jsconfig.json` includes:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "baseUrl": ".",
      "paths": {
        "@/*": ["./*"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- If the files are missing, create them or revert related changes.

### 2. Missing or incorrect exports in 'components/ui/button'

- Error: `Module "@/components/ui/button" has no exported member 'ButtonProps'.`
- Solution: Check if `ButtonProps` is exported from `components/ui/button.tsx`. If not, add:
  ```tsx
  // In components/ui/button.tsx
  export type ButtonProps = {
    /* your prop types */
  };
  // Or export from an existing type definition
  ```
- Also, make sure `ButtonProps` is not renamed or moved.

### 3. Props errors (`'size' is missing` and `'size' specified more than once`)

- Example: `'size' is specified more than once, so this usage will be overwritten.`
- Solution: In `components/ui/pagination.tsx`, check where you pass the `size` prop. Make sure each instance only specifies `size` once. For missing `size`:
  ```tsx
  <Button size="md" onClick={...} disabled={...} />
  ```
- If `ButtonProps` requires `size`, provide a default or required value everywhere you use `<Button>`.

### 4. Declared but unused variables

- Warnings about unused variables like `'Laptop'`, `'Smartphone'`, `'ConditionType'`, etc., can be resolved by either removing the declarations or using them in your code.

### 5. Coverage/Codecov error

- Codecov is warning that `./coverage/lcov.info` doesn't exist. Make sure your test command generates a coverage report at the expected location, or adjust the upload path.

---

**Summary of fixes:**

- Verify file/module existence and correct import paths.
- Ensure all required exports exist (especially `ButtonProps` in the button component).
- Resolve prop duplication and make sure required props are present.
- Remove or use unused variables.
- Make sure coverage reports are generated for Codecov.

If you show key files (like `components/ui/button.tsx`, `components/ui/pagination.tsx`, and `tsconfig.json`), I can give exact code samples. Let me know if you need more details!
