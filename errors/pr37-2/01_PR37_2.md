The failing job (58834174814) encountered this error:
❌ Bundle size exceeds 320MB

According to the workflow, your build process enforces a maximum bundle size of 320MB. The actual bundle size is 324MB, which triggers the failure.

### Solution

You should reduce your build bundle size below 320MB. Here are practical steps:

1. **Analyze Bundle Contents**
   - Use tools like `webpack-bundle-analyzer` or similar to inspect which packages or assets contribute most to the size.

2. **Eliminate Unused Dependencies**
   - Remove packages or code that are no longer in use.

3. **Optimize Assets**
   - Compress images, and minify CSS/JS files.
   - Consider code-splitting where possible.

4. **Lazy Load Features**
   - Implement lazy loading for routes and heavy components.

5. **Externalize Large Libraries**
   - Move rarely used, large libraries to CDN or load them separately when required.

6. **Update Bundle Size Script**
   - If you raised the threshold temporarily, revert it only if bundle optimization is not feasible, but this is not recommended.

### Code Suggestions

If your bundle size checking script is in your workflow, you should not simply raise the limit:

```bash
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 320 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 320MB"
  exit 1
fi
```

Instead, keep this threshold and optimize your codebase as described above.

If you need help finding specific files or lines contributing to your bundle size, let me know what bundler or build system you use, and I can guide more specifically.

**Quick action:** Start with your build report (`npm run build --report` or equivalent), and prioritize reducing largest assets first.
