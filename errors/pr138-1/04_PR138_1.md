Solution:
Your job failed because the dependencies listed in your lockfile do not match those in package.json. Specifically:

- The lockfile has one dependency added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1.
- Five dependencies were removed: axios, nodemailer, react-image-crop, @types/nodemailer, @types/react-image-crop.

How to fix:

1. Run the following command to synchronize your lockfile with package.json:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. If your project uses yarn, run:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```
3. Commit any changes to your lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock), and push.

If you intentionally added or removed dependencies, ensure both package.json and the lockfile are in sync.

Code suggestion:
After making changes to dependencies, always run your package manager’s install command and commit the lockfile. This will resolve the log error and allow the workflow to succeed.
