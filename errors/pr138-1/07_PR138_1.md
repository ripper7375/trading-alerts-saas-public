The logs show that the job failed because one or more of the required test jobs did not succeed—either the unit, integration, or build jobs. In your workflow's Test Summary job (see lines 170–176 in .github/workflows/tests.yml), if any of the prerequisites ("unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", or "build-check") fails, the summary job also fails with exit 1.

To fix this, you need to address the underlying failures in those jobs. Review the logs for the "unit-and-component-tests", "integration-tests", and "build-check" jobs to determine which one failed and why. Address test failures, lint errors, type checks, Prisma client generation, or build process issues reported in those steps.

If jobs are being skipped (as the log line "- ✅ Integration Tests: skipped" shows), make sure you are not using workflow filters (branches, conditions) that accidentally prevent jobs from running. Double-check the matrix and dependency configuration in your workflow to ensure all needed jobs are executed.

After you fix any individual job failures, the Test Summary job will pass as well.

Example fix if unit tests are failing:

- Run pnpm run test:ci locally and resolve any failing tests.
- If the build step fails due to bundle size, optimize your Next.js code or assets so the size does not exceed the configured threshold.
