The failing job log shows this error:

> Specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
>
> - 1 dependency was added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
> - 5 dependencies were removed: axios@^1.6.2, nodemailer@^7.0.7, react-image-crop@^10.1.5, @types/nodemailer@^6.4.14, @types/react-image-crop@^8.0.0

This means your package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync. You either added/removed dependencies in package.json and did not update the lockfile, or made changes directly to the lockfile.

**Solution:**

1. Run `pnpm install` (or `npm install` if not using pnpm) locally to update your lockfile to match your package.json changes.
2. Commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json) together with package.json.

Example commands:

```sh
pnpm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: sync lockfile with package.json"
git push
```

After this, your CI job should pass the dependency check.

Additionally, if you removed @types/nodemailer and related packages intentionally, ensure you also remove their usage in the codebase. If not, add back any crucial dependencies to package.json, re-run the install, and re-commit both files.
