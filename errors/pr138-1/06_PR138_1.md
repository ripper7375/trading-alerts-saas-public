The job failed because the dependencies listed in package.json and your lockfile are out of sync. Specifically:

- 1 dependency was added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
- 5 dependencies were removed: axios@^1.6.2, nodemailer@^7.0.7, react-image-crop@^10.1.5, @types/nodemailer@^6.4.14, @types/react-image-crop@^8.0.0

This mismatch leads to the process exiting with an error.

Solution:

- Run npm install or yarn install locally to regenerate your lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) so it matches your package.json.
- Commit and push the updated lockfile.

Example with npm:

```sh
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix: sync lockfile with package.json"
git push
```

This will resolve the dependency specifiers mismatch and allow the CI job to pass.
