The job failed due to a mismatch between dependencies listed in package.json and those in your lockfile (likely package-lock.json or pnpm-lock.yaml):

- 1 dependency was added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
- 5 dependencies were removed: axios, nodemailer, react-image-crop, @types/nodemailer, @types/react-image-crop

Solution:
To fix this, synchronize your lockfile with your updated package.json. Run the following command (based on your package manager):

For npm:

```bash
npm install
```

For pnpm:

```bash
pnpm install
```

For yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

Afterwards, commit the updated lockfile to your branch. This will resolve the dependency mismatch and allow your workflow to pass.

If you removed or added dependencies in package.json, always regenerate and commit the lockfile to avoid these CI errors.
