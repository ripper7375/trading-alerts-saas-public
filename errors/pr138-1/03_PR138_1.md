The job failed because the lockfile (likely package-lock.json or yarn.lock) does not match the dependencies specified in package.json. The error message shows:

- 1 dependency was added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
- 5 dependencies were removed: axios@^1.6.2, nodemailer@^7.0.7, react-image-crop@^10.1.5, @types/nodemailer@^6.4.14, @types/react-image-crop@^8.0.0

This indicates that package.json and the lockfile are out of sync.

Solution:
You need to update the lockfile so it matches your package.json. Follow these steps:

1. Run the following command locally (choose the one matching your package manager):

For npm:

```sh
npm install
```

For yarn:

```sh
yarn install
```

2. This will regenerate the lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock) with the correct dependencies.

3. Commit and push the updated lockfile:

```sh
git add package-lock.json  # or yarn.lock if you're using yarn
git commit -m "fix: update lockfile to match package.json"
git push
```

This should resolve the job failure. If you need to inspect the differences, compare your package.json with your lockfile and make sure all changes are committed together.
