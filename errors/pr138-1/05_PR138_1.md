The failing job 59203642945 reports this error:

> Specifiers in the lockfile don't match specifiers in package.json:
>
> - 1 dependencies were added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
> - 5 dependencies were removed: axios@^1.6.2, nodemailer@^7.0.7, react-image-crop@^10.1.5, @types/nodemailer@^6.4.14, @types/react-image-crop@^8.0.0

This means your package.json and package-lock.json are out of sync. Your package.json (see on ref a63464fd1afa7df4e9425711bf44c29c07cf3115) lists @next/bundle-analyzer as a devDependency and does not list the 5 removed dependencies, but your lockfile still tracks them as present or missing. Also, you are using pnpm with the --frozen-lockfile flag, which will fail if there is any mismatch.

**Solution:**  
Regenerate your lockfile using pnpm so it matches the current package.json, commit the new lockfile, and push. You can do this by running from your local repository root:

```sh
pnpm install
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "fix: sync lockfile with package.json"
git push
```

If you use npm instead, run:

```sh
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix: sync lockfile with package.json"
git push
```

Then re-run the workflow; this should resolve the job failure.

**Note:** Keeping the lockfile and package.json in sync is required by the workflow step that installs dependencies with --frozen-lockfile on branch ref a63464fd1afa7df4e9425711bf44c29c07cf3115.
