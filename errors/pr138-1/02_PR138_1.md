The failing job error is caused by a mismatch between the dependencies listed in package.json and your lockfile (likely package-lock.json or yarn.lock):

- 1 dependency was added: @next/bundle-analyzer@^16.1.1
- 5 dependencies were removed: axios, nodemailer, react-image-crop, @types/nodemailer, @types/react-image-crop

Solution:

1. Run your package manager's install command to sync the lockfile:
   - For npm: npm install
   - For Yarn: yarn install
2. If you made intentional changes to dependencies in package.json, commit the updated lockfile (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).
3. If these changes in dependencies were unintentional, review your package.json and revert unwanted changes, then rerun your package manager to resync the lockfile.

After these steps, push the updated lockfile and re-run the workflow. This will resolve the specifier mismatch and the job will pass.

If you need a code snippet for npm:

```sh
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Fix: sync lockfile with package.json"
git push
```

Or for Yarn:

```sh
yarn install
git add yarn.lock
git commit -m "Fix: sync yarn.lock with package.json"
git push
```

Let me know if you need help checking your package.json or identifying recent dependency changes!
