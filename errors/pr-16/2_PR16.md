I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me first get the job logs to understand what went wrong. The logs show that this is a summary job that's failing because one or more test jobs failed. Let me get more details about the workflow to identify which specific test jobs failed: The job that failed is the **Test Summary** job, which is a reporting job that checks whether all previous test jobs succeeded. The failure itself is intentional—it's designed to fail when any of the dependent jobs (unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check) fail.

## Root Cause

Looking at the workflow structure, one or more of these jobs failed:

- `unit-and-component-tests`
- `integration-tests`
- `build-check`

The Test Summary job detected this and correctly failed with the message "❌ One or more test jobs failed".

## Solution

You need to investigate which of the actual test jobs failed. Check the workflow run for PR #16 to identify which job(s) have a red X. The most common failures are:

1. **Unit & Component Tests** - Check for:
   - TypeScript errors (`pnpm run type-check`)
   - ESLint violations (`pnpm run lint`)
   - Test failures (`pnpm run test:ci`)

2. **Integration Tests** - Check for test failures in `pnpm run test:integration`

3. **Build Check** - Check for:
   - Build errors (`pnpm run build`)
   - Bundle size exceeding 300MB

Once you identify the failing job, you can view its logs to see the specific error. The Test Summary job itself doesn't need fixing—it's working as designed by reporting that upstream tests failed.
