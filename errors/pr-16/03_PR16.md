I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me get the logs first. This appears to be a summary job that aggregates results from other test jobs. Let me get more context by checking the workflow file and the pull request details. ## Solution for Failing Job

The job that's failing is the **Test Summary** job, which is a dependent job that checks the results of three upstream jobs:

1. Unit & Component Tests
2. Integration Tests
3. Build Check

The summary job shows that the Integration Tests and Build Check were **skipped**, which causes the condition on lines 154-156 to fail because it expects all three jobs to have a `success` result.

### Root Cause

Jobs are being skipped because they have dependencies (`needs: `) on previous jobs that likely failed or were cancelled. The workflow has this dependency chain:

- `integration-tests` depends on `unit-and-component-tests`
- `build-check` depends on both `unit-and-component-tests` and `integration-tests`

When an earlier job fails, dependent jobs are skipped by default.

### Fix

Update the workflow to allow dependent jobs to run even if previous jobs fail by adding `if: always()` to the integration and build jobs:

```yaml
integration-tests:
  name: Integration Tests
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: unit-and-component-tests
  if: always() # Add this line

  steps:
    # ... rest of the job

build-check:
  name: Production Build Check
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  needs: [unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests]
  if: always() # Add this line

  steps:
    # ... rest of the job
```

Alternatively, if you want a cleaner approach, modify the test-summary condition to handle skipped jobs:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

This way, skipped jobs won't cause the summary to fail - only actual failures will trigger an error. The first solution is better if you want to ensure all tests run regardless of earlier failures.
