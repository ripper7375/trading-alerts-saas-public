The failure is in the "Production Build Check" job. According to the logs, the build check step failed due to a bundle size exceeding the allowed 350MB threshold.

Solution:

- Investigate files and dependencies added recently that could have caused the .next/ bundle directory to exceed 350MB.
- Remove unused packages, assets, or code splitting to reduce the bundle size.
- Use dynamic imports in your Next.js application for large dependencies.
- For more details, see the bundle size threshold logic in the build-check job of your workflow: [tests.yml#L127-L135 (ref: 264b3b7b1e41befe3d6d18ed08db6854a94fd8ee)](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/264b3b7b1e41befe3d6d18ed08db6854a94fd8ee/.github/workflows/tests.yml#L127-L135).

If you need help identifying specific files or code that increase your bundle size, consider using Next.js’ built-in bundle analyzer plugin.

Example addition to your package.json scripts:

```json
"analyze": "cross-env ANALYZE=true next build"
```

and install next-bundle-analyzer:

```bash
pnpm add @next/bundle-analyzer -D
```

Then, update next.config.js:

```js
const withBundleAnalyzer = require('@next/bundle-analyzer')({
  enabled: process.env.ANALYZE === 'true',
});
module.exports = withBundleAnalyzer({});
```

After running pnpm run analyze, review the output and reduce large imports as needed.
