The failure occurred because the production Next.js bundle size is 355MB, exceeding the workflow's 350MB threshold (see the build-check job in .github/workflows/tests.yml at ref 264b3b7b1e41befe3d6d18ed08db6854a94fd8ee). To resolve this:

1. Reduce the output bundle size below 350MB. Try:
   - Removing unused dependencies.
   - Enabling Next.js output and dependency analysis (e.g., using next-bundle-analyzer).
   - Applying code splitting and dynamic imports for large/admin routes.
   - Reviewing .next/ directory for large static assets or oversized API routes.

2. If it's not possible to reduce the size due to project requirements, you may temporarily increase the allowed threshold in .github/workflows/tests.yml:

```yaml
# In the build-check job
if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 360 ]; then
echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 360MB"
exit 1
fi
```

(Replace 360 with an appropriate new ceiling if justified.)

Primary recommendation: Optimize bundle size to pass the existing 350MB limit and ensure maintainability. If increasing the limit, document a plan for future optimization.
