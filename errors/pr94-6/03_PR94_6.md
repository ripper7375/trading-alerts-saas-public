The failing job 59002397138 encountered the error: "❌ One or more test jobs failed" with an exit code 1 in the Test Summary step of the workflow. This conclusion step aggregates the status of the Unit & Component Tests, Integration Tests, and Production Build Check (see .github/workflows/tests.yml, lines 144–159 on ref e6ad77f04796f96d0b329545bb9a6d2b294cd065). The summary job itself failed because at least one required job did not complete successfully.

To resolve this:

1. Check the results of the jobs "unit-and-component-tests," "integration-tests," and "build-check" in this workflow run. Identify any job(s) with a status of failure.
2. Investigate the failing job's steps and associated logs to pinpoint the root cause (such as test failures, lint/type errors, dependency installation issues, or a bundle size exceeding 350MB).
3. Address the underlying issue—for example, fix failing tests, resolve linter/type errors, or optimize the build if the bundle size is too large.

After correcting the issue, commit and push the changes to trigger a new run. This should resolve the test summary failure if all individual jobs succeed. For more details, review each job step and consult the relevant scripts invoked in the workflow.
