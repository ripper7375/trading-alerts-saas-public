I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing due to mismatched dependencies between your `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

- `@types/node`: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, manifest has `^20.19.27`
- `@types/react`: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, manifest has `^18.3.27`

## Solution

Run the following command to regenerate your lockfile with the updated dependency versions:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will update `pnpm-lock.yaml` to match the versions specified in your `package.json`. Then commit and push the updated lockfile:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm lockfile to match package. json"
git push
```

The CI check is ensuring that your lockfile stays in sync with your package.json to prevent dependency drift and ensure reproducible builds.
