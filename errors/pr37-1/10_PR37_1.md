I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. The job is failing because of a **pnpm lockfile mismatch**. The lockfile versions don't match the versions specified in your `package.json`:

- `@types/node`: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, but manifest has `^20.19.27`
- `@types/react`: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, but manifest has `^18.3.27`

## Solution

Update your `pnpm-lock.yaml` to match the package.json versions by running:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml` file:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "Update pnpm lockfile to match package. json dependencies"
git push
```

This will regenerate the lockfile with the correct dependency versions that match your `package.json` manifest, resolving the CI failure.
