I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. ## Solution for Failing Job

The job is failing due to **dependency version mismatches** between `package.json` and `package-lock.json`. The build process detected inconsistencies in the dependency versions.

### The Problem

Two dependencies have mismatched versions:

- **@types/node**: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, manifest has `^20.19.27`
- **@types/react**: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, manifest has `^18.3.27`

### The Fix

Run the following command to regenerate the lockfile and sync it with your `package.json`:

```bash
npm install
```

This will update your `package-lock.json` to match the versions specified in `package.json`. After running this command, commit the updated `package-lock.json` file:

```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "fix:  update package-lock.json to match package. json dependencies"
git push
```

### Why This Happened

Your `package.json` has been updated with newer versions of these type definitions (`@types/node@^20.19.27` and `@types/react@^18.3.27`), but the lockfile still references older versions. The CI workflow's dependency validation step caught this mismatch.

### Additional Note

The Codecov error that appears after the dependency check is a secondary issue - it fails because the build never completes. Once you fix the dependency mismatch, the tests will run and generate the coverage report that Codecov expects.
