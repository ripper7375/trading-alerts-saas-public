I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me start by getting the job logs. The job is failing because of a **dependency version mismatch** between your `package.json` (manifest) and `package-lock.json` (lockfile).

## Problem

Two dependencies have mismatched versions:

- `@types/node`: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, but package.json has `^20.19.27`
- `@types/react`: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, but package.json has `^18.3.27`

## Solution

Run the following command locally to regenerate the lockfile with the correct versions:

```bash
npm install
```

This will update `package-lock.json` to match the versions specified in `package.json`. Then commit and push the updated lockfile:

```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json to match package.json dependencies"
git push
```

The CI check should pass after this update.
