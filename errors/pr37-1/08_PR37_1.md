I'll help you find a solution for the failing job. Let me first get the logs to see what went wrong. ## Solution for Job Failure

The job is failing due to **dependency version mismatches** between your `package.json` and `pnpm-lock.yaml`. The `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` command detected these inconsistencies:

- `@types/node`: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, but package.json specifies `^20.19.27`
- `@types/react`: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, but package.json specifies `^18.3.27`

### Fix

Run this command locally to update your lockfile:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Then commit the updated `pnpm-lock.yaml`:

```bash
git add pnpm-lock.yaml
git commit -m "chore: update pnpm lockfile to match package. json dependencies"
git push
```

### Why This Happened

Your `package.json` dependencies were updated (lines 106 and 108), but the `pnpm-lock.yaml` file wasn't regenerated to reflect these changes. The `--frozen-lockfile` flag in the CI workflow (line 129) prevents automatic updates and requires an exact match between the manifest and lockfile.

### Additional Note

The Codecov warnings at the end are non-blocking since they have `continue-on-error: true` set in the workflow (line 258). However, if you want to upload coverage reports in the future, you'll need to either:

- Add a `CODECOV_TOKEN` secret to your repository
- Generate test coverage files before the upload step runs
