The failing job reports two core issues:

1. **Dependency Mismatches:**
   - `@types/node` has `lockfile: ^20.10.0`, but in your `package.json` manifest it’s `^20.19.27`.
   - `@types/react` has `lockfile: ^18.2.42`, but in your manifest it’s `^18.3.27`.

   **Solution:**
   - Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to sync the lockfile with your manifest.
   - Commit and push the updated `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.

2. **Postgres Role Error:**
   - The database log reports: `FATAL: role "root" does not exist`
   - This means your workflow or test setup is trying to connect to Postgres using a `root` role, which isn’t defined.

   **Solution:**
   - Update your database connection configuration (likely in your `.env.test`, workflow file, or database setup script) to use a valid Postgres role (often `postgres` for dev containers).
   - Example (in `.env` or workflow):
     ```
     DB_USER=postgres
     # DB_USER=root <-- change/remove this line if present
     ```

**Actions Required:**

- Sync your dependencies by running the install command and updating the lockfile.
- Change your database user configuration from `root` to `postgres` or a valid role.

Apply these fixes, re-run your workflow, and the job should pass. If you need help with the exact file edits, let me know!
