I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution. Let me start by getting the logs for job 58832851357.The issue is that your `package-lock.json` is out of sync with your `package.json`. The lockfile has older versions of two dependencies than what's specified in your manifest:

- **@types/node**: lockfile has `^20.10.0`, manifest has `^20.19.27`
- **@types/react**: lockfile has `^18.2.42`, manifest has `^18.3.27`

## Solution

Run the following command locally to update your lockfile:

```bash
npm install
```

This will synchronize `package-lock.json` with the versions specified in `package.json`. Then commit and push the updated lockfile:

```bash
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update package-lock.json to match package. json"
git push
```

The CI check will pass once the lockfile is in sync with your package.json.
