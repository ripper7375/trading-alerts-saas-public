I'll analyze the failing job to find a solution for you. This is a summary job that failed because one or more upstream test jobs failed. Let me check the workflow file and get the full run logs to see which specific test failed: ## Solution

The failing job is the **Test Summary** job, which is failing because one of its dependent jobs (`unit-and-component-tests`, `integration-tests`, or `build-check`) failed or was skipped. The logs show that both `integration-tests` and `build-check` were **skipped**, which means the `unit-and-component-tests` job likely failed.

### The Problem

The workflow has a flaw in its conditional logic at lines 153-156. The condition checks if any job result is not `'success'`, but skipped jobs return `'skipped'` as their result, not `'success'`. This causes the Test Summary job to fail even when jobs are intentionally skipped due to an upstream failure.

### The Fix

Update the conditional in `.github/workflows/tests.yml` to handle skipped jobs properly:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
    needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

This changes the logic from checking for `!= 'success'` (which includes skipped jobs) to checking for `== 'failure'` (which only fails when a job actually fails).

Alternatively, if you want to fail on both failures and cancellations but allow skipped jobs:

```yaml
- name: Fail if any test failed
  if: |
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.unit-and-component-tests.result) ||
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.integration-tests. result) ||
    contains(fromJSON('["failure", "cancelled"]'), needs.build-check.result)
  run: |
    echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
    exit 1
```

**Note:** You'll also need to investigate why the `unit-and-component-tests` job failed, as that's the root cause of the skipped jobs. Check the logs for that specific job to identify the actual test failure.
