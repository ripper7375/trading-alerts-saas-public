The failing job is primarily caused by ESLint errors in your TypeScript code. To fix the failures, you need to resolve the "defined but never used" and "prefer-const" linting issues. Here’s what you should do:

**1. Remove or use the unused variables as flagged by ESLint:**

- `isDLocalCountry` in `app/api/payments/dlocal/create/route.ts` (line 27): If unused, delete it.
- `finalAmount` in `app/api/payments/dlocal/create/route.ts` (line 134): Remove if not used, otherwise use it in your logic.
- `orderId` in `app/api/payments/dlocal/create/route.ts` (line 147): Same action—remove if not used.
- `extractUserIdFromOrderId` in `app/api/webhooks/dlocal/route.ts` (line 21): Remove if not actually used.

**2. Change let to const for variables that are never reassigned:**

- Change `let finalAmount` to `const finalAmount` on line 134 of `app/api/payments/dlocal/create/route.ts`.
- Change `let discountAmount` to `const discountAmount` on line 135 of the same file.

**Example Fixes for `app/api/payments/dlocal/create/route.ts`:**

```typescript
// Before
let finalAmount = ...; // assigned but never used
let discountAmount = ...; // never reassigned

// After
// Delete finalAmount if unused, otherwise use it.
// If used, ensure it's used and change to const
const discountAmount = ...;

// Remove isDLocalCountry and orderId if not used elsewhere in the file.
```

**Example Fix for `app/api/webhooks/dlocal/route.ts`**:

```typescript
// If extractUserIdFromOrderId is not used, delete its definition.
```

Once you have made these changes, commit and push them—your lint check should pass.

If you wish to ignore these lint errors temporarily (not recommended for production), you can disable the relevant rules at the top of the affected files:

```typescript
/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars, prefer-const */
```

But the best practice is always to address the unused variables and variable assignments.

Let me know if you need code snippets for specific lines or further details for these files.
