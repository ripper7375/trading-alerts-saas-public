The job failed due to the "Fail if any test failed" step in .github/workflows/tests.yml. This step triggers a failure if any of the jobs unit-and-component-tests, integration-tests, or build-check did not succeed. The logs show that integration tests and build checks were skipped, causing the summary to report a failure.

To resolve this, ensure that the integration and build jobs are not conditionally skipped. Confirm their triggers and remove any workflow logic that would skip these jobs on your branch or for your pull request. Also, verify that all dependencies for each job are set correctly so that required jobs are not inadvertently skipped.

If skipping is needed for certain cases, explicitly handle it with conditions—otherwise, keep all jobs active to pass this summary-check step. For example, make sure the jobs under jobs: are not excluded via if: conditions or workflow configuration. If you don’t want the test-summary job to enforce strict passing for optional jobs, adjust the conditions in the test-summary job as follows:

```yaml
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
```

This change will avoid failing the workflow when jobs are skipped intentionally and only fail if there is an actual failure. Review your branch, workflow dispatch, or conditional setup to ensure all jobs run as required.
