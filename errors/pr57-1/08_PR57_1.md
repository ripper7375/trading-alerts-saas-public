The job failed due to TypeScript errors in scripts/test-prisma5-upgrade.ts:

1. Property 'DEBUG' must be accessed as process.env['DEBUG'] instead of process.env.DEBUG.
2. result.\_count is of type unknown in the aggregation; it should be accessed with result['_count'].

Suggested code changes:

- Line 27:
  Replace:

  ```typescript
  log: process.env.DEBUG ? ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'] : ['error'],
  ```

  With:

  ```typescript
  log: process.env['DEBUG'] ? ['query', 'info', 'warn', 'error'] : ['error'],
  ```

- Line 131:
  Replace:
  ```typescript
  details: `Aggregation: ${result._count.id} users`;
  ```
  With:
  ```typescript
  details: `Aggregation: ${(result as any)['_count'].id} users`;
  ```
  Or, ideally, cast result['_count'] to the expected type if you know it.
