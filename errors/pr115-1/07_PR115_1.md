The failure occurred in the "Test Summary" job because one or more dependent jobs failed. The logs show the message "❌ One or more test jobs failed" and an exit code 1. To resolve this, review the status of the following jobs in your workflow:

- unit-and-component-tests
- integration-tests
- build-check

Focus on the step within each job that runs tests or the build (e.g., pnpm run test:ci, pnpm run test:integration, pnpm run build). The failure may be due to:

1. Failing or misconfigured tests.
2. Lint or type-check errors.
3. Bundle size exceeding the 360MB threshold in the build-check job.

Check the logs for each of these jobs and address any errors reported. For example:

- If a test or lint step fails, fix the code or test case and re-run the workflow.
- If the bundle size exceeds 360MB, optimize your Next.js build or increase the threshold with caution in the build check step of .github/workflows/tests.yml:
  ```yaml
  if [ $BUNDLE_SIZE -gt 360 ]; then
  echo "❌ Bundle size exceeds 360MB"
  exit 1
  fi
  ```

After fixing the issues, commit your changes and verify that all jobs pass.
