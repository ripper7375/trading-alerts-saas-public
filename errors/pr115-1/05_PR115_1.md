The job failed due to several TypeScript errors in components/auth/register-form.tsx:

1. Variable shadowing and block-scoped variable issues:
   - You declare const on line 136: const onSubmit = async (data: RegistrationFormData): ..., and then re-declare data inside this function: const data = await response.json(); (line 157). This shadows the parameter and leads to TS2448 errors (“Block-scoped variable 'data' used before its declaration.”).

2. Implicit “any” type issues:
   - The submitData variable (line 142) and response (line 149) are missing explicit type annotations, leading to TS7022 errors.

Solution:

- Rename the variable data from await response.json() to something like json, to avoid shadowing the function parameter data.
  Example:

```tsx
const json = await response.json();
```

Then, update references to this variable accordingly, e.g., replace setError(data?.error || ...) with setError(json?.error || ...).

- Add type annotations for submitData and response variables as appropriate. For example:

```tsx
const submitData: {
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  referralCode?: string;
} = {
  name: data.name,
  email: data.email,
  password: data.password,
  referralCode: verifiedCode || undefined,
};
```

- You may also explicitly type the json variable as any if you are not using a concrete interface:

```tsx
const json: any = await response.json();
```

Apply these changes in components/auth/register-form.tsx on ref b7f7bcac2c18a66e68f714406f89cdaa763a836d. This will resolve the TypeScript and variable errors currently causing the CI job to fail.
