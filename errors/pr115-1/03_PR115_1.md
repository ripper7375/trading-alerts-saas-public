The failing job is caused by a TypeScript ESLint error in components/auth/register-form.tsx at line 136:

Error: 'data' is defined but never used. Allowed unused args must match /^\_/u. @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars

Solution:
In the onSubmit function, the data parameter is unused. To resolve this, rename the parameter from data to \_data so it matches the ESLint convention for intentionally unused parameters.

Replace line 136:

```tsx
const onSubmit = async (data: RegistrationFormData): Promise<void> => {
```

with

```tsx
const onSubmit = async (_data: RegistrationFormData): Promise<void> => {
```

If data should actually be used within the function, update the implementation accordingly. Otherwise, renaming as shown will resolve the lint error and allow your workflow to pass.
