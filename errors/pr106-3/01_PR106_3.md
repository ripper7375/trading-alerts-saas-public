The primary failure in job 59026035514 is due to errors in your API route handlers, as well as a configuration issue:

### 1. Missing/Invalid `CRON_SECRET` in Environment

Error:  
`console.error('CRON_SECRET not configured')`  
File: `app/api/cron/process-pending-disbursements/route.ts:24`  
Solution:

- Ensure that the `CRON_SECRET` environment variable is set and available to your workflow runner.
- In GitHub Actions, go to your repository’s **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
- Add the secret named `CRON_SECRET` with the correct value.

Example for local `.env`:

```env
CRON_SECRET=your_cron_secret_value
```

### 2. Database Errors in Admin API Routes

Errors like:

- `Admin P&L report error: Error: Database error` (`app/api/admin/affiliates/reports/profit-loss/route.ts:170`)
- `Admin affiliates list error: Error: Database error` (`app/api/admin/affiliates/route.ts:99`)
- `Admin users error: Error: Database error` (`app/api/admin/users/route.ts:202`)

These are due to underlying database access issues (the error messages are generic: "Database error").

Solution Checklist:

- Verify database connection/configuration in your API route files.
- Make sure environment variables for DB connection (likely in `.env` or GitHub Secrets) are present and correct.
- If you’re using a mock/test DB for CI, ensure it is properly initialized before tests run.

Example code improvement (showing better error handling and logging):

```typescript
try {
  // Database query or logic
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Admin P&L report error:', error);
  // Optionally log error details to Sentry or another tracker
  return NextResponse.json(
    { error: 'Failed to generate P&L report' },
    { status: 500 }
  );
}
```

If you're doing this already, check if your DB host, user, password, and port secrets are set and available.

### 3. Failing Tests Expecting Error Handling

Some API tests expect 500 errors (e.g., for `/api/indicators`), which often means your tests are running with incomplete setup, or your mocks are not present.
Solution:

- Confirm test setup is creating mock data or initializing dependencies as expected.
- If mocking MT5 service, ensure the mock is active for these tests.

### 4. Codecov Token Missing

Codecov fails to upload coverage due to missing upload token:

Solution:

- In your repository’s **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**, add a secret called `CODECOV_TOKEN` if your repo is private (or if tokenless upload is not enabled).
- Get the token from your Codecov project page.

---

### ✅ Summary of Actions:

- Add/set the `CRON_SECRET` in your GitHub Actions/environment.
- Check/set database connection secrets/variables.
- Review your test setup for proper DB/mock initialization.
- Add `CODECOV_TOKEN` for coverage upload.

Implementing these should resolve the failing job and tests. If you need details on updating a specific file, let me know!
