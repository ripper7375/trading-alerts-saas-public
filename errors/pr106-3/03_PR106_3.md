The job failed because at least one of the prior test jobs (unit, integration, or build check) did not complete successfully. The log shows this line caused the failure:

```bash
echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
exit 1
```

This logic is defined at the end of your workflow (.github/workflows/tests.yml):

```yaml
152|       - name: Fail if any test failed
153|         if: |
154|           needs.unit-and-component-tests.result == 'failure' ||
155|           needs.integration-tests.result == 'failure' ||
156|           needs.build-check.result == 'failure'
157|         run: |
158|           echo "❌ One or more test jobs failed"
159|           exit 1
```

To fix the failure, review the outputs of the unit, integration, and build check jobs to identify which specific job is failing. The root cause will be in the logs of the job(s) marked as failed. Address the code, build, or test issues in those jobs.

If you only want the Tests Summary job to report status and not cause a failure, you could remove or comment out the exit line:

```yaml
# 159|           exit 1
```

Otherwise, fix the test or build issues upstream. You can see the workflow for reference here: [.github/workflows/tests.yml@2235ee80](https://github.com/ripper7375/trading-alerts-saas-public/blob/2235ee80d761ced107e0293fb88cf7f9074f1d0e/.github/workflows/tests.yml).
