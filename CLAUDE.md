# CLAUDE.md — Executor State & Standing Rules (Migration Mode)

> **This repo is in MIGRATION MODE.** You (Claude Code) are the **Executor** in the
> three-role Development Chain Protocol (Advisor = Claude Cowork plans, Davin authorizes,
> you execute). Full operating manual: `docs/migration-orders/EXECUTOR-PROTOCOL.md` —
> **read it at the start of every session before doing anything else.**
> The previous content of this file (Aider validation guide) moved to
> `docs/AIDER-VALIDATION-GUIDE-legacy.md`; its validation commands are still used (see manual).

---

## Current state _(update at the end of EVERY session)_

> **STANDING INSTRUCTION (Davin, 2026-07-22, NARROWED 2026-07-24 — still in force
> until Davin lifts it further):** chain-length-one originally read as "webhooks cut
> over FIRST (both providers), before 4A-7 or any Slice 4 work." **Davin confirmed
> live, 2026-07-24, that this narrows to dLocal-cutover-first**: with dLocal now
> CUT-OVER (Session 4A-5, see Current below), 4A-7/Slice 4 work is unblocked — it does
> NOT need to wait for RiseWorks. RiseWorks's own cutover (`4A-5-RW`) trails
> independently, gated on RiseWorks replying with webhook/API settings (see Waiting on).
> **Session 4A-3 (below) was an explicit, scoped exception Davin asked for directly in
> chat — Slice 1 (crons) cutover, independent of this question — not itself a lifting
> of the standing instruction.** With dLocal cut over too, Slice 3/4 BUILD work (4A-7
> onward) may now proceed; RiseWorks-specific work stays gated on `4A-5-RW`'s own entry
> criteria.

- **Current:** Session 4A-W1 CLOSED, executed as CONTRACT — Part 19.5 (Wise) contracts &
  decisions, no code, no schema, no money moved — 2026-07-26.
  **CONFIRM found the order file itself mid-edit:** `git status` showed
  `4a-w1-wise-contracts-and-decisions.migration-order.md` as modified-but-uncommitted;
  `git diff` against the last commit revealed the header had been flipped `DRAFT → APPROVED`
  with no Advisor/Davin approval commit trail, and — independently — all five of the order's
  own cited line-count entry-criteria numbers had each shifted by exactly `+1` away from both
  the committed version and the live codebase (`base-provider.ts` 174→175,
  `provider-factory.ts` 105→106, `payment-orchestrator.service.ts` 333→334, `app.module.ts`
  75→76, `non-market-data/schema.prisma` 1023→1024 — plus a sixth, non-entry-criterion number
  in the handoff section, `transaction.service.ts` 310→311). This is the same shape as
  `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` L11's four prior recurrences (self-contradicting/uncommitted order
  status) — stopped and reported to Davin rather than trusting or silently correcting either
  field. Davin confirmed live: the `DRAFT→APPROVED` edit was his own intentional approval, and
  he separately restored all five line-count numbers to the correct `wc -l` baseline before
  saying go. Re-verified live: paths exist, line counts hold exactly (174/105/333/75/1023),
  zero drift against the design doc. Order then marked CONFIRMED and executed.
  **Steps executed:** read the full docset (`00`→`07`, `01`, `02`, `04` in full per the
  order's own reading order; `03`/`05`/`06` read in full rather than skimmed, since `05`'s
  paste-ready blocks were needed verbatim and `02`/`03`/`06` fed the OpenAPI freeze/secret
  matrix directly). Business Payment Approval rules: **confirmed absent** on the Wise business
  account (Davin, live) — no action needed before 4A-W6. **F36 resolved: Model A** (Business +
  personal API token) — Davin's 2026-07-25 "design for both" superseded by an explicit live
  choice this session; funding stays `MANUAL` regardless (Thailand region gate), and F36 also
  fixes the webhook subscription level as profile-level for F40. **F37 resolved: `MANUAL`** —
  Thailand region re-confirmed live. Sandbox identity bootstrapped: `GET /v1/profiles`
  (Davin ran it himself, response body shared back, token never entered this session) →
  business `WISE_PROFILE_ID` = `29617748` (type `business`; a sibling personal profile
  `29617747` also exists and was **not** recorded as the business ID). `WISE_SOURCE_CURRENCY`
  = `USD`, balance confirmed to exist on the account (Davin). F38–F41 registered OPEN in
  `DECISION-LOG.md`'s flag register with owners/due sessions (F43 deliberately **not**
  registered — stays deferred to 4A-W4 per the order's own scope). F42 recorded RESOLVED
  (RiseWorks archive-not-delete) with the full entry from the docset template.
  `4a-5-rw-money-service-riseworks-webhook-cutover.migration-order.md` marked **REVOKED**
  (file retained). `part19.5-wise-disbursement-openapi.yaml` reviewed against live
  money-service code — guard names (`JwtAuthGuard`/`AdminGuard`/`AffiliateGuard`), the global
  `/v1` prefix excluding `health`/`health-auth` (`main.ts`, 51 lines), and a route-collision
  check against all 8 registered controllers: zero drift, zero collisions — `info.description`
  marked `Status: CONTRACT (frozen at 4A-W1)`. The §5.2 Wise-state mapping table in
  `01-…architecture-design.md` marked invariant. `docs/secret-matrix.md` extended with all
  `WISE_*` variables and the token promotion plan (read-only 4A-W1/W3/W5, full access only from
  4A-W6). THB-not-testable-in-sandbox limitation recorded in this order's Deviations and
  carried into the `4A-W2` PRE-DRAFT.
  **Artifacts updated:** `4a-w1-wise-contracts-and-decisions.migration-order.md` (Status →
  CONFIRMED, Deviations filled), `DECISION-LOG.md` (flag-register rows F36–F42 + full
  resolution entries for F36/F37/F42 + the payment-approval finding),
  `4a-5-rw-…migration-order.md` (REVOKED), `part19.5-wise-disbursement-openapi.yaml` (frozen),
  `01-…architecture-design.md` (§5.2 invariant marker), `docs/secret-matrix.md` (Wise section),
  `monolith-to-microservices-migration-session-playbook.md` (Part 19.5 session block + quick-
  reference rows), `SESSION-PROMPT-SCRIPT.md` (4A-W1…W8 rows), this file.
  `4a-w2-wise-additive-schema.migration-order.md` PRE-DRAFTed (INFRA+PORT).
- \_(superseded-by-above, retained for context) Session 4A-7b CLOSED, executed as VERIFY-RETIRE — money-service Slice 3
  read-API CUTOVER, both flag groups flipped ON in production — 2026-07-26.
  **CONFIRM found entry criterion #2 FAILED, not just unverified:** value-blind
  `vercel env ls` (all environments) showed `MONEY_SERVICE_URL`,
  `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_AFFILIATE`, and `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_ADMIN` did not exist
  anywhere in Vercel — 4A-7a's close-out claim of "added to `.env.example`" was accurate
  but never carried into the real environment. This was not benign: `MONEY_SERVICE_URL`
  absent means `lib/money-service/client.ts:15`'s `?? 'http://localhost:3002'` fallback
  would have hard-failed 100% of a flipped group's traffic against an unreachable local
  address, with no graceful degradation (the flag itself disables the monolith
  fallback). Stopped and reported to Davin rather than silently fixing or silently
  proceeding; Davin approved the fix live. **Fix executed:** added all 3 vars to Vercel
  production (`MONEY_SERVICE_URL` set to money-service's real Railway address, both
  flags `false`), redeployed to establish a genuine OFF baseline
  (`trading-alerts-saas-frontend-bt69dabys.vercel.app`), re-verified value-blind, then
  smoke-tested both route groups unauthenticated before touching the checklist.
  Order then marked CONFIRMED. **Cutover executed:** Group (a)
  `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_AFFILIATE=true` + redeploy, confirmed clean, then Group (b)
  `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_ADMIN=true` + redeploy, confirmed clean. Unauthenticated
  smoke test after each flip: all 4 affiliate routes → 500, confirmed as the
  pre-existing L12 bug (`error.message`-vs-`.code`, present identically in all 4 route
  files — the flag check runs after `requireAffiliate()`, so it can't be caused by the
  flip); all 8 admin routes → 401, guards correct, no L12-class bug on this group. No
  code changed anywhere this session — 3 env var writes + 3 redeploys only, per this
  VERIFY-RETIRE order's near-zero creativity dial. **Not fully closed:** no real
  authenticated request has yet been observed reaching money-service post-cutover in
  either group (see Waiting-on #40) — same open-monitoring-caveat class as Slices 1/2.
  **Artifacts updated:** `4a-7b-money-service-read-apis-cutover.migration-order.md`
  (Status → CONFIRMED, entry criteria checked, Deviations recorded in full),
  `DECISION-LOG.md` (new Session 4A-7b entry), `migration-cutover-table.md` (Slice 3 row
  → `CUT-OVER`), this file.
- \_(superseded-by-above, retained for context) Session 4A-7a CLOSED, executed as
  UI-BUILD (+CONTRACT) — money-service
  Slice 3 read-API transport BUILD, zero traffic cut over — 2026-07-25.
  **CONFIRM:** re-verified Blocker-1's httpOnly evidence live (all four points held
  exactly at their cited lines); re-verified Session 4A-6's 12 GET routes still 401
  unauthenticated (live spot-check); reviewed the parity baseline
  (`4a-6_test-results_ready_to_proceed_with_4a-7a.md`, 12/12 green). Audited Waiting-on
  #36/#38 against live Railway deployment history rather than trusting the existing
  CLAUDE.md claims: **#36 closed clean** (deployment `b401bc62`'s natural `[CRON]` ticks
  across the full 2026-07-23 UTC 00:00–04:00 window, `errorCount: 0`, zero duplicate
  rows). **#38 found NOT closed** — walked every deployment since the signature fix and
  found the "confirmed live — correct DB writes, second replay idempotent" language in
  this file and `migration-cutover-table.md` unsupported by the logs (the only two
  logged deliveries were pre-replay-guard-fix synthetic payloads that both 404'd on
  `Payment record not found`, zero DB writes). Raised this live with Davin rather than
  silently resolving either way; Davin's correction: that verification never actually
  happened against a live DB record, only unit/integration-tested in development — #38
  stays OPEN with this corrected context (see Waiting-on below), non-blocking for this
  BUILD-only session. Also found `npm run validate`'s `validate:format` step failing on
  287 files — traced to `core.autocrlf=true` on this Windows checkout (CRLF vs.
  prettier's LF default), a pre-existing environmental artifact, not a regression;
  Davin's live ruling: `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint --max-warnings 0` (both re-verified
  clean after every edit) is the code baseline for this repo on Windows, not the full
  `validate:format`/`validate:policies` chain — `prettier --write` across 287 files was
  explicitly declined as an out-of-scope drive-by.
  **F45 resolved** (Davin, live): Option (a) server-side proxy — Next.js route handlers
  read the httpOnly session cookie server-side and forward it as `Authorization: Bearer`
  to money-service, mirroring `lib/operation-service/client.ts`'s proven pattern.
  money-service's `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` CORS allowlist becomes dead config under this
  decision — do not widen it later "to fix CORS." **F44 resolved** (Davin, live):
  Option (a) manual parity verification (the 12/12-route parity check already on file)
  stands in for the 48h shadow-run, matching the F35 precedent. Both logged in full in
  `DECISION-LOG.md`.
  **Built:** `lib/money-service/client.ts` (mirrors operation-service's
  `MoneyServiceError`/error-mapping shape), `lib/money-service/routes.ts` (server-only
  cookie read + typed wrappers for all 12 Slice-3 routes), `lib/money-service/flags.ts`
  (`MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_AFFILIATE` / `_ADMIN`, both default OFF — split per-group so
  4A-7b's own per-group flip order and its "no code work" constraint both hold). Wired
  the flag check into all 12 existing Next.js API route handlers — the monolith's own
  `requireAffiliate()`/`requireAdmin()` check always runs first, unchanged; only on a
  pass does the flag gate a branch to money-service, falling through to the existing
  Prisma logic when OFF (the default in every environment, including production).
  `MONEY_SERVICE_URL` + both flags added to `.env.example`.
  **Step 5 (prove one signed-in call end-to-end):** per Davin's explicit direction, used
  a temporary scratch script minting a real NextAuth v4 session token (via
  `next-auth/jwt`'s own `encode()`, same `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`) for the project's canonical
  `affiliate-test@trading-alerts.test` / `free-test@trading-alerts.test` fixtures
  (seeded via the existing dev-only `/api/test/seed` endpoint — no real customer data
  touched), run against a local dev server with the affiliate flag on and
  `MONEY_SERVICE_URL` pointed at live production money-service. Confirmed in Railway's
  HTTP logs that the forwarded request genuinely reached money-service (not the
  monolith fallback); `JwtAuthGuard` correctly decoded the forwarded Bearer JWE and
  `AffiliateGuard` correctly authorized it. The response was a `404` rather than `200`
  — traced to local dev's `DATABASE_URL` (likely the F34 staging Postgres project)
  being a **different database** than money-service's production `DATABASE_URL`
  (confirmed by querying each directly) — the seeded test fixture genuinely doesn't
  exist in the DB money-service reads, so the 404 is money-service's Prisma layer
  working correctly against real data, not a transport failure. 403 negative case
  (non-affiliate token) verified correct. 401 negative case (no cookie) surfaced a
  **pre-existing, unrelated bug**: `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` L12 (the monolith's
  `stats/route.ts` catch block checks `error.message` for a marker `AuthError` only
  ever sets on `.code`) — falls through to a generic 500 instead of 401; untouched by
  this session's edits, out of scope to fix here. Davin's live call: this evidence is
  sufficient proof of the F45 transport/auth-bridge working end-to-end — did not write
  test data into production to force a literal 200. Scratch script + local dev server
  both cleaned up after use.
  **Artifacts updated:** `4a-7-money-service-read-apis-cutover.migration-order.md`
  (already SUPERSEDED by the Advisor when 4A-7a was drafted), `DECISION-LOG.md` (F44/F45
  full entries), `migration-cutover-table.md` (Slice 3 row), `migration-stack-analysis.md`
  (new `lib/money-service/*` files + 12 modified route handlers), this file.
  `4a-7b-money-service-read-apis-cutover.migration-order.md` PRE-DRAFTed (VERIFY-RETIRE).
- \_(superseded-by-above, retained for context) Session 4A-5 CLOSED, executed as
  money-service webhooks Slice 2 CUTOVER (dLocal-only, scope-amended 2026-07-24) —
  2026-07-24.
  **CONFIRM (two live passes this session):** first pass found the order's own header
  read `DRAFT (scope-amended, awaiting Davin's approval)` — not APPROVED, contrary to
  the initial framing — and found no evidence yet of Entry Criterion #2 (a real signed
  dLocal webhook verified against the new endpoint); stopped and asked Davin live
  rather than assume, per the order's own explicit gate. Second pass, after Davin's own
  shadow-run/debugging work landed: found two real bugs already fixed and recorded as
  Deviations, both explicit Davin-authorized scoped exceptions (EXECUTOR-PROTOCOL.md §7
  money/auth escalation) — `8e681297` (signature verification read a `x-signature`
  header dLocal never sends; real signature is `Authorization: V2-HMAC-SHA256,
Signature: <hex>` over `X-Login+X-Date+body`, not the raw body alone) and `1cc31b24`
  (webhook replay of an already-COMPLETED payment created a duplicate "Welcome to
  PRO!" `Notification` row — `Payment`/`Subscription`/`Commission` writes were already
  idempotent, only `notification.create()` lacked a guard). The order's own Deviations
  notes explicitly flagged that neither fix alone satisfied Entry Criterion #2 — asked
  Davin live whether the actual post-fix real-signed-payload replay had been verified;
  confirmed yes (correct `Payment`/`Subscription` DB writes, second replay idempotent).
  Also confirmed live: chain-length-one narrows to dLocal-cutover-first (see standing
  instruction above).
  **Flip executed** (order's Checklist step 3, dashboard-side, by Davin): dLocal
  Merchant Dashboard webhook URL updated to
  `https://money-service-production.up.railway.app/v1/webhooks/dlocal`. Railway logs
  checked immediately after: clean boot, no errors, but no real payment webhook had
  landed in that log window yet.
  **Monitoring caveat (order's Checklist step 4, not fully closed this session):** the
  first live post-flip delivery hasn't been directly observed — spot-check `railway
logs` for money-service on the next real dLocal payment (expect no errors, correct
  `Payment`/`Subscription` row updates) before treating dLocal as fully stable.
  Recorded in `migration-cutover-table.md`'s Slice 2 row.
  **Process note:** a `railway variables --kv` check (to confirm `DLOCAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  was set) printed the actual secret value into the session transcript — should have
  been a value-blind existence check instead. Value not reproduced in any artifact;
  Davin may want to weigh rotation given it now sits in a transcript. New
  `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` entry recorded.
  **Artifacts updated:** `migration-cutover-table.md` (Slice 2 row →
  `CUT-OVER (dLocal only)`, RiseWorks portion noted separately), `CLAUDE.md` (this
  block, chain-length-one narrowing, Waiting-on). `DECISION-LOG.md` — no flag applies
  to this specific cutover mechanism, left unchanged.
- **Current order:**
  `docs/migration-orders/4a-w1-wise-contracts-and-decisions.migration-order.md` (CONFIRMED
  and executed by Executor 2026-07-26). `docs/migration-orders/4a-w2-wise-additive-schema.migration-order.md`
  PRE-DRAFTed at this close, status `PRE-DRAFT`, requires Davin present (production schema
  change). Predecessor money-service order
  `4a-7b-money-service-read-apis-cutover.migration-order.md` stays CUT-OVER/closed (see
  historical block below), superseding `4a-7-…`/`4a-7a-…` (both SUPERSEDED, retained as audit
  trail). `4a-5-rw-money-service-riseworks-webhook-cutover.migration-order.md` now
  **REVOKED** (2026-07-26, Session 4A-W1) — RiseWorks replaced by Wise per F42, file retained.
- **Order status (4A-W1):** all-green — no code written, no schema changed, no money
  touched, `git diff --stat` shows documentation/order-file changes only. F36/F37 RESOLVED,
  F38–F41 registered OPEN, F42 RESOLVED, Business Payment Approval confirmed absent,
  `WISE_PROFILE_ID` (sandbox business) captured, OpenAPI + state table frozen. Standing note:
  `DISBURSEMENT_PROVIDER` stays `MOCK` in production until `4A-W7` cuts over — **no real
  affiliate payout goes out through money-service before then; any order that would create a
  real payment batch before 4A-W7 is out of order, stop and ask Davin.**
- **Order status (4A-7b, historical):** CUT-OVER — both `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_AFFILIATE` and
  `MIGRATE_READ_APIS_MONEY_ADMIN` are `true` in Vercel production, redeployed and
  smoke-tested clean (see the 4A-7b historical block below for the CONFIRM-time gap
  found/fixed and the monitoring caveat carried to Waiting-on #40). CC-F freeze on the
  monolith's own affiliate/admin route + `lib/` logic stays until a future RETIRE session.
- **Order status (4A-7a, historical):** BUILT, zero traffic cut over — flags default
  OFF in every environment at the time. **What shipped:** transport module
  (`lib/money-service/client.ts`, `routes.ts`, `flags.ts`), flag wiring into all 12
  existing Slice-3 route handlers, F44/F45 resolved and logged, end-to-end
  proxy+auth-bridge proof. Superseded by 4A-7b's cutover above.
- **Prior order (4A-5, historical):** dLocal CUT-OVER, all-green (monitoring caveat
  above). RiseWorks portion not started. **What shipped (dLocal only):**
  - Two live-escalated bugfixes (full detail in Current above): dLocal webhook
    signature verification (`8e681297`) and a replay-guard on webhook completion side
    effects (`1cc31b24`). Both documented as Deviations in the order itself, both
    tested (34/34 then full-suite 260/260 pass, `tsc --noEmit` clean).
  - dLocal's provider-dashboard webhook URL repointed to money-service's
    `/v1/webhooks/dlocal` endpoint — the cutover moment itself, per this order's own
    framing (no code flag, no redeploy).
  - RiseWorks's route stays deployed-but-silent exactly as 4A-4 left it — untouched,
    unweakened, zero live traffic, dashboard still pointed at the monolith.
- **Last session did:** Session 5-4 ("Fonts, Streaming & Phase 5 Exit Review",
  `next@16.2.10`) — closed 2026-07-23. Phase 5 (Next.js 16 Optimization) fully closed &
  verified (F10 RESOLVED): Google `Inter` font loader with system-font fallbacks,
  React 19 `<Suspense>` streaming boundaries verified across dynamic routes,
  `vercel.json`/`next.config.js` deployment rules validated. Full exit suite green:
  `type-check` 0 errors, `validate:lint` 0 errors, `build` 127/127 routes (29.82 MB
  bundle vs <340MB ceiling), `test:ci` 117/117 suites, 2082/2082 tests. Live Vercel
  production deployment verified (commit `be62d87f`).
- **Waiting on:** all Session 4A-4 items unchanged except where noted below (renumbered
  continuation). (1)-(6), (11)-(12), (17)-(20), (23), (27)-(29) unchanged — see prior
  closes for full text. **(26, PARTIALLY RESOLVED Session 4A-5)** `DLOCAL_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
  now confirmed set on Railway production (this session) — `RISE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` still
  not set, moves to `4A-5-RW`'s own entry criteria; Stripe/Resend secrets status
  unchanged/unverified this session. **(31, RESOLVED Session 4A-5)** Session 4A-5's real
  signed-payload replay requirement — done: real dLocal webhook traffic verified against
  the fixed signature-verification code, correct `Payment`/`Subscription` writes,
  second replay confirmed idempotent (Davin, live). **(37, CLOSED BY REVOCATION, Session
  4A-W1)** `4A-5-RW` (RiseWorks webhook cutover) is now **REVOKED**, not merely still
  PRE-DRAFT — RiseWorks is being replaced by Wise (Part 19.5, F42 RESOLVED), so its blocking
  entry criterion (RiseWorks replying with webhook/API settings) is moot. Closed by
  revocation, not resolution — no reply from RiseWorks was ever received or needed.
  **(38, still OPEN, audited Session 4A-7a —
  narrowed and corrected)** dLocal's cutover flipped the dashboard URL, but the
  completion/replay-guard execution path against a live database record has still never
  been exercised by a real HTTP request in production. 4A-7a walked every Railway
  deployment from the signature fix (`8e681297`, live 2026-07-24 11:58 UTC) through the
  current deployment (HTTP edge logs + app stdout logs): the only two deliveries logged
  anywhere are `shadow-run-cash`-labeled synthetic payloads (12:02/12:23 UTC on
  deployment `ea69c732`) that both hit `Payment record not found for webhook`
  (zero DB writes) and both predate the replay-guard fix (`1cc31b24`, live 13:48 UTC) —
  every deployment since shows zero webhook activity of any kind. This corrects the
  "confirmed live by Davin — correct Payment/Subscription DB writes, second replay
  idempotent" language recorded under Session 4A-5 above and in
  `migration-cutover-table.md`'s Slice 2 row: **Davin's live clarification (4A-7a,
  2026-07-25) is that no such verification against a live DB record has actually
  happened yet — only unit/integration-tested during development.** Per Davin's call
  this is non-blocking for 4A-7a (BUILD-only, zero traffic cut over) and carries forward;
  it remains a real open item before dLocal Slice 2 can be called fully stable — spot-check
  `railway logs` on the next real (or deliberately-run realistic synthetic) dLocal
  payment. **(39, NEW)** `npm run validate`'s `validate:format` step (`prettier --check
.`) fails on 287 files repo-wide — traced this session to `core.autocrlf=true` on this
  Windows checkout (files carry CRLF line terminators, prettier's default expects LF),
  not a content/style regression. Davin's live ruling let 4A-7a proceed on
  `tsc --noEmit` + `eslint --max-warnings 0` alone, but the underlying gap (no
  `.gitattributes` line-ending normalization, `validate:format`/`validate:policies`
  effectively unenforceable on Windows) is still there — worth a future session's
  attention (likely a `.gitattributes` fix + one-time `prettier --write` pass on a
  dedicated branch, not a drive-by inside a feature session) before relying on
  `validate:format` again. **(30, unresolved, now 3
  sessions running)** `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` still at 40 active lessons (L1-L40) — AT the
  stated cap; this session found 2 more genuinely new lessons (recorded in the 4A-6
  order's own Deviations + LESSONS-LEARNED.md's header note instead of as new numbered
  entries, per the file's own "pause before adding another" instruction) without a
  consolidation pass happening. Flagged in Sessions 4A-2, 4A-4, and now 4A-6 — this is
  no longer a one-off, it needs the Advisor's attention before the next order that
  touches this file. **RESOLVED same-day by Davin**: the Advisor ran the consolidation
  pass 2026-07-22 — old lessons moved to `LESSONS-ARCHIVE.md`, active file is now clean
  (L1-L10), and L1 codifies item #32 below. **(32, CORRECTED — was wrongly framed as
  CRITICAL/actionable by this session, corrected same-day by Davin):** money-service does
  **NOT** have its own database — per blueprint §5.1 ("Phase 1: one instance, two
  roles/schemas"), it shares the MONOLITH's single Postgres instance via the `money_svc`
  role (L36) and only ever defines a schema SUBSET. Sessions 4A-2/4A-4/4A-6 running only
  `prisma generate` (never `db push`/`migrate deploy`) from money-service was therefore
  the CORRECT and ONLY safe behavior, not a gap — running either from money-service would
  risk dropping the monolith's own tables that aren't in money-service's subset. The
  monolith remains the sole owner of all schema migrations; money-service's schema.prisma
  subset just needs to keep matching whatever the monolith's migration history already
  established. New `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` L1 (Session 4A-6, Advisor review) makes this a
  hard rule — read it before ever considering a Prisma migration command from
  money-service again. **(33, RESOLVED same-day by Davin — chain-length-one invoked)**
  Session 4A-6's own predecessor order arrived APPROVED with an internally contradicted,
  untracked, no-git-history file while Session 4A-5 was still unresolved at DRAFT, so two
  cutover orders (4A-5, 4A-7) ended up pending simultaneously. Davin's ruling: invoke
  "chain-length-one" — **stop all BUILD work**; Davin is manually running 4A-5's
  shadow-run verification himself and webhooks (Slice 2) will cut over FIRST, before
  anything else (including 4A-7) proceeds. No further Slice 3/4 work until Davin says so.
  **(34, RESOLVED same-day by Davin)** 4A-7's browser-auth design question: blueprint
  §4.2 — "No cookie sharing across domains — the frontend sends `Authorization: Bearer`."
  The Next.js frontend will manually extract its JWT and attach it as a Bearer header
  when calling money-service's Read APIs. `JwtAuthGuard`/`AdminGuard`/`AffiliateGuard`
  (already built, Session 4A-6) need no changes — confirmed correct as-is by Davin. 4A-7's
  order updated to reflect this; still blocked on chain-length-one (#33) regardless.
  **(35, NEW)**
  `migration-stack-analysis.md`'s money-service section was never updated after Session
  4A-1 — Sessions 4A-2 and 4A-4's new files (crons/dlocal/riseworks/disbursement/
  affiliate-support modules) were never recorded there, a standing gap this session
  found and flagged but did not backfill (out of scope, full regen is an 8.6-only task
  per `00-SKELETON-AND-RULES.md` §5) — only this session's own additions were appended.
  **(29, RESOLVED Session 4A-3)** money-service's own unfinished manual-trigger
  verification step (4A-2's blocker for the crons cutover) — completed and confirmed
  live with Davin this session, all 8 jobs idempotent. **(36, RESOLVED Session 4A-7a)**
  Session 4A-3's cutover landed; this item tracked the scheduler's own natural tick
  (not the manual-trigger bypass) under the new live regime. Confirmed clean at 4A-7a
  CONFIRM: Railway deployment `b401bc62` ran continuously 2026-07-22 10:12 UTC →
  2026-07-24 05:34 UTC, spanning the natural 2026-07-23 UTC 00:00–04:00 window. All five
  hourly `[CRON]` ticks fired and completed with `errorCount: 0`, zero duplicate
  `PaymentBatch`/`DisbursementTransaction` rows. Slice 1 is fully stable. **(40, NEW)**
  Slice 3's read-API cutover (4A-7b, 2026-07-26) is live in production for both flag
  groups, but no real authenticated request has yet been directly observed reaching
  money-service through either group — this session's verification was build health,
  unauthenticated-guard smoke tests, and absence-of-errors in logs, not a live
  authenticated round trip (minting a production auth token was judged out of this
  VERIFY-RETIRE session's scope — touches secrets/auth semantics beyond the order's
  explicit steps). Same open-monitoring-caveat class as #36 (resolved) and #38 (still
  open) — spot-check Railway money-service logs + Vercel function logs the next time a
  real affiliate or admin actually loads their dashboard, before calling Slice 3 fully
  stable. **(41, NEW)** Part 19.5 (Wise) replaces RiseWorks as the disbursement provider —
  `docs/migration-orders/replace-rise-with-wise/` is the governing docset (`00`–`07` + the
  OpenAPI spec). Sessions `4A-W1…4A-W8` are inserted between 4A-7 and 4A-8 (Davin,
  2026-07-25); `4A-W1` executed 2026-07-26. **(42, NEW — commercial, shapes everything
  downstream)** The Wise business account is registered in **Thailand**, not on Wise's
  API-funding allowlist (US, CA, AU, NZ, SG, MY) for personal API tokens, and F36 resolved to
  **Model A** (personal token, not a Platform partnership) — so **every payout cycle needs
  one manual funding action by Davin in the Wise app**, indefinitely, unless F36 is revisited.
  The architecture handles this (funding is a batch _state_, not a method call) and a
  funding-SLA alarm (F43, registered at 4A-W4) prevents silent stalls. **(43, NEW)**
  `WISE_API_TOKEN` is a money-moving secret. Plan: **read-only** token for 4A-W1/W3/W5,
  promoted to **full access** only at 4A-W6. Verify presence **value-blind** — never
  `railway variables --kv` (L17). This session's own sandbox `GET /v1/profiles` call was run
  by Davin outside this chat; only the response body (profile IDs `29617747`
  personal/`29617748` business, types) was shared back — no token value entered this
  transcript. **(44, NEW)** THB cannot be exercised end-to-end in Wise's sandbox (UK-region,
  stable only for GBP/USD/EUR) — recorded in `4a-w1-…`'s Deviations and carried into the
  `4A-W2` PRE-DRAFT. Consequence: `4A-W3` must fetch the real THB account-requirements schema
  from **production** (read-only, no money); `4A-W6`'s E2E runs on a sandbox-supported
  currency pair; `4A-W7`'s single smoke payout is the first real proof of the THB route.
- **Next session:** Davin's call, per `4a-w1-…`'s own Next-session-handoff note.
  `4a-w2-wise-additive-schema.migration-order.md` (Part 19.5's additive Prisma migration — 5
  new tables + the `WISE` enum value) is PRE-DRAFTed at status `PRE-DRAFT` — **requires Davin
  present** (production schema change, `EXECUTOR-PROTOCOL.md` §7) and must run from the
  monolith only, never `db push`/`migrate deploy` from money-service (L1). Separately: a
  future RETIRE session can delete the monolith's now-orphaned
  `app/api/affiliate/dashboard/*`, `app/api/admin/{affiliates,analytics}/*` routes and their
  `lib/` logic once Davin agrees Slice 3 (4A-7b) has been stable long enough — not yet
  scheduled. `4A-5-RW` (RiseWorks) is now REVOKED (Waiting-on #37), not pending. `Session 6-1`
  (Phase 6 Gap Matrix, `docs/migration-orders/6-1-gap-matrix-f11.migration-order.md`) was
  PRE-DRAFTed at 5-4's close, a separate track — Davin to decide ordering against Slice 4
  (4A-8), the Slice-3-RETIRE session, and the now-active `4A-W*` series.
- **Open flags:** F1 fully RESOLVED (Session 0-3) · F2 RESOLVED (Session 0-1) · F3
  RESOLVED (Session 1-1: on Railway, different instance than `railway-gateway`) · F17
  RESOLVED (Session 0-5: synthetic seed only) · F18 RESOLVED (Session 1-1: RPO ≤ 24h,
  RTO ≤ 1h, with an unverified-backup-cadence gap — re-confirmed unchanged Session 1-4;
  this is the reason Phase 1 isn't marked exit-clean) · **F19 fully RESOLVED (Session
  2-1)** — audit + bump + codemods + production deploy, all verified · **F20 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 2-3)** — migration history baselined, `drop_watchlists`
  strip-and-orphaned per Davin, FK audit applied to production · **F4 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 2-2)** — model census, 1 market + 26 non-market + `RefreshToken`
  stub · **F5 fully RESOLVED (Session 2-4)** — split clients live in production code,
  every consumer repointed, old schema retired · **F21 OPEN** (24h Account-Deletion
  GDPR gap — requires Davin's product decision on hard-delete vs anonymize, scheduled
  for a future session) · **F22 fully RESOLVED (Session 2-4)** · **F6 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 3-1)** — bridge-first confirmed, the 3 "missing" reference docs
  found but explicitly disregarded (superseded OpenAuth seed material) · **F7 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 3-1)** — Path B (`JwtAuthGuard` decrypts NextAuth's JWE
  directly), proven via a real round-trip before the guard was built · **F23 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 3-2)** — `RefreshToken` hardened (hashed-at-rest via SHA-256,
  revocable, `userAgent`/`ipAddress`), applied to production as a pure `CREATE
TABLE` (the table never actually existed before) · **F24 fully RESOLVED (Session
  3-2)** — `/auth/login` issues NextAuth-compatible JWEs, same format `JwtAuthGuard`
  already verifies · **F25 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-3)** — test locally + deploy
  directly to production, Davin's call; a repeatable local-testing recipe now exists
  (L31/L32) · **F26 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-3)** — reuse NextAuth's exact cookie
  (corrected to the real per-environment name/attributes at CONFIRM, not the
  Decision Log's dev-mode shorthand) · **F27 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-3)** — defer
  `/auth/register` routing until email-sending is ported, unchanged from Davin's
  call · **F28 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-4)** — continue the F25 local-testing
  precedent, using real Resend API keys · **F29 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-4)** —
  port `lib/email/email.ts` in full into operation-service · **F30 fully RESOLVED
  (Session 3-4)** — CORS confirmed unnecessary, server-side proxying continues ·
  **F31 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-5)** — SVC_TOKEN leg descoped, pure VERIFY-RETIRE
  for SSR + browser legs · **F32 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-5)** — Davin set both
  missing Railway env vars, confirmed live at CONFIRM · **F33 fully RESOLVED
  (Session 3-5)** — production check completed same-session against the live
  Vercel URL, NextAuth confirmed unregressed, no outstanding items · **F15 fully
  RESOLVED (Session 4A-1, Davin)** — money-service reuses the existing shared
  Railway Redis instance, `op.*`/`money.*` namespaces, not a dedicated instance ·
  **F16 fully RESOLVED (Session 4A-1, Davin)** — public URL scheme
  `<api.domain/v1 + money.domain/v1>` · **F34 fully RESOLVED (Session 3-5, Davin)** —
  reuse the existing "postgre for staging" Railway project whenever CC-A's staging
  gap is actually addressed (base Postgres/Redis already provisioned there; nothing
  else built yet) · **F35 fully RESOLVED (Session 4A-2, Davin) — cutover EXECUTED
  Session 4A-3** — money-service crons Slice 1's shadow-run mechanism given F34/CC-A
  isn't ready: `CRON_ENABLED` gate + manual-trigger verification, not a literal parallel
  staging run; 4A-3 flipped the gate and emptied `vercel.json`'s crons, Slice 1 is now
  CUT-OVER (monitoring caveat, Waiting-on #36) ·
  **F36 fully RESOLVED (Session 4A-W1, Davin)** — Wise integration Model A (Business +
  personal API token); funding stays `MANUAL` regardless (Thailand region gate) ·
  **F37 fully RESOLVED (Session 4A-W1, Davin)** — `WISE_FUNDING_MODE=MANUAL`, Thailand not on
  Wise's API-funding allowlist · **F38 OPEN** (Wise fee bearer + quote amount direction — due
  4A-W2, Davin, commercial) · **F39 OPEN** (Wise recipient-details collection surface —
  affiliate self-service vs admin-entered — due 4A-W3, Davin, product) · **F40 OPEN** (Wise
  webhook subscription level: profile vs application — follows F36, due 4A-W5) · **F41 OPEN**
  (Wise recipient PII retention/deletion; interacts with F21 — due 4A-W3, Davin) ·
  **F42 fully RESOLVED (2026-07-25, Davin; recorded 4A-W1)** — RiseWorks archived, not
  deleted: dormant in repo AND database, restorable per `replace-rise-with-wise/03-…` ·

## Non-negotiables (short form — manual has details)

1. **Never execute an order that is not CONFIRMED.** Lifecycle: PRE-DRAFT → DRAFT →
   APPROVED (Davin) → CONFIRMED (you, after re-verifying code AND runtime state).
2. **One session = one verifiable unit of work.** Never end mid-cutover or half-deployed.
   Blocked? Document the blocker and stop — don't push into a broken state.
3. **Artifacts are the only channel.** Your session transcript dies with the session; the
   Deviations section, CLAUDE.md, Decision Log, cutover table, and file inventory are how
   the Advisor and Davin know what happened. Empty Deviations = starved next plan.
4. **Scope discipline.** No drive-by fixes to change-frozen (CC-F) or out-of-scope code.
   `lib/api/index.ts` is known-broken BY DESIGN — do not fix until Phase 7.
5. **Money and auth changes escalate.** Anything touching payments, grants, secrets, CORS,
   or auth semantics beyond the order's explicit steps → stop and ask Davin.
6. **Verification is never skipped, only strengthened.**

## Security Override Policy (retained from legacy guide — still binding)

Do **NOT** modify `overrides`/`pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` on feature branches, even
if `pnpm audit` complains. Security overrides are managed centrally on `main` via dedicated
PRs (`check-overrides.yml` enforces this; 7+ documented merge-conflict incidents caused the
rule — see `errors/continuous-pr-errors/`).
